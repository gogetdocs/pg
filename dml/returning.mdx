## Returning Data from Modified Rows

### Overview

The `RETURNING` clause is a powerful feature in SQL that allows you to retrieve data from modified rows while they are being manipulated. This clause can be used with `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` commands to avoid performing extra database queries to collect the data.

### Allowed Contents of RETURNING Clause

The allowed contents of a `RETURNING` clause are the same as a `SELECT` command's output list. It can contain:

- Column names of the command's target table
- Value expressions using those columns
- A shorthand `RETURNING *` to select all columns of the target table in order

### Usages

#### INSERT with RETURNING

The `RETURNING` clause is useful in `INSERT` statements when relying on computed default values, such as serial columns to provide unique identifiers.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (firstname text, lastname text, id serial primary key);

INSERT INTO users (firstname, lastname) VALUES ('Joe', 'Cool') RETURNING id;
```

This will return the ID assigned to the new row.

#### INSERT ... SELECT with RETURNING

The `RETURNING` clause is also useful with `INSERT ... SELECT` statements.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (firstname text, lastname text, id serial primary key);
CREATE TABLE new_users (firstname text, lastname text);

INSERT INTO users (firstname, lastname)
  SELECT firstname, lastname FROM new_users
  RETURNING id;
```

This will return the IDs assigned to the new rows.

#### UPDATE with RETURNING

In an `UPDATE` statement, the `RETURNING` clause returns the new content of the modified row.

**Example:**

```sql
UPDATE products SET price = price * 1.10
  WHERE price <= 99.99
  RETURNING name, price AS new_price;
```

This will return the name and new price of the modified rows.

#### DELETE with RETURNING

In a `DELETE` statement, the `RETURNING` clause returns the content of the deleted row.

**Example:**

```sql
DELETE FROM products
  WHERE obsoletion_date = 'today'
  RETURNING *;
```

This will return all columns of the deleted rows.

#### Triggers and RETURNING

If there are triggers on the target table, the data available to `RETURNING` is the row as modified by the triggers.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (name text, price numeric, obsoletion_date date);
CREATE TRIGGER update_obsoletion_date
  BEFORE UPDATE ON products
  FOR EACH ROW
  SET NEW.obsoletion_date = CURRENT_DATE;

UPDATE products SET price = price * 1.10
  WHERE price <= 99.99
  RETURNING name, price AS new_price, obsoletion_date;
```

This will return the name, new price, and updated obsoletion date of the modified rows.
