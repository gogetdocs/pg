## Updating Data in a Database

=====================================================

Updating data in a database involves modifying existing rows in a table. This can be done using the `UPDATE` command, which requires three pieces of information:

- The name of the table and column to update
- The new value of the column
- Which row(s) to update

### Basic Syntax

---

The basic syntax of the `UPDATE` command is as follows:

```sql
UPDATE table_name
SET column_name = new_value
WHERE condition;
```

### Example

---

Suppose we have a table called `products` with a column called `price`. We want to update all products that have a price of 5 to have a price of 10.

```sql
UPDATE products
SET price = 10
WHERE price = 5;
```

This command will update all rows in the `products` table where the `price` column is 5.

### Updating Multiple Columns

---

You can update more than one column in an `UPDATE` command by listing more than one assignment in the `SET` clause.

```sql
UPDATE mytable
SET a = 5, b = 3, c = 1
WHERE a > 0;
```

This command will update all rows in the `mytable` table where the `a` column is greater than 0.

### Using Expressions

---

The new value of the column can be any scalar expression, not just a constant. For example, if you want to raise the price of all products by 10%, you can use:

```sql
UPDATE products
SET price = price * 1.10;
```

This command will update all rows in the `products` table by multiplying the current price by 1.10.

### Omitting the WHERE Clause

---

If the `WHERE` clause is omitted, all rows in the table will be updated.

```sql
UPDATE products
SET price = 10;
```

This command will update all rows in the `products` table to have a price of 10.

### Using Conditions

---

The `WHERE` condition does not have to be an equality test. Many other operators are available (see Chapter 9). But the expression needs to evaluate to a Boolean result.

```sql
UPDATE products
SET price = 10
WHERE price > 5;
```

This command will update all rows in the `products` table where the `price` column is greater than 5.

### Best Practices

---

- Always specify a `WHERE` clause to avoid updating all rows in the table.
- Use primary keys to reliably address individual rows.
- Use graphical database access tools to update rows individually.
- Test your `UPDATE` commands before running them on a live database.
