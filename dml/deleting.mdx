## Deleting Data

### Overview

Deleting data in SQL involves removing entire rows from a table based on specified conditions. This is achieved using the `DELETE` command, which has a syntax similar to the `UPDATE` command.

### Syntax

The basic syntax of the `DELETE` command is as follows:

```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

- `table_name`: The name of the table from which you want to delete rows.
- `condition`: The condition that specifies which rows to delete. If omitted, all rows in the table will be deleted.

### Usage

#### Example 1: Deleting Specific Rows

Suppose you have a `products` table with the following structure and data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO products (id, name, price)
VALUES
(1, 'Product A', 10.00),
(2, 'Product B', 20.00),
(3, 'Product C', 10.00);
```

To delete all rows from the `products` table where the price is 10, you would use the following `DELETE` statement:

```sql
DELETE FROM products
WHERE price = 10;
```

After executing this statement, the `products` table would contain only the row with `id` = 2.

#### Example 2: Deleting All Rows

To delete all rows from the `products` table, you would use the `DELETE` statement without specifying a condition:

```sql
DELETE FROM products;
```

**Caution**: This will remove all data from the table. Use with caution.

### Best Practices

- **Always specify a condition** unless you intend to delete all rows.
- **Use transactions** when performing deletions to ensure data integrity and to allow for rollbacks in case of errors.
- **Backup your data** regularly to prevent loss of important information.
