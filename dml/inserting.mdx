# **Inserting Data into a Database**

### Overview

Inserting data into a database is a crucial step in making it useful. In this section, we will cover the basics of inserting data into a PostgreSQL database using the `INSERT` command.

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax of the `INSERT` command is as follows:

```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);
```

Here, `table_name` is the name of the table where you want to insert the data, and `column1`, `column2`, etc. are the names of the columns where you want to insert the data. The `VALUES` clause specifies the values to be inserted into the corresponding columns.

### Example Usage

Let's consider an example using the `products` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_no integer,
    name text,
    price numeric
);

INSERT INTO products (product_no, name, price) VALUES (1, 'Cheese', 9.99);
```

This will insert a new row into the `products` table with the specified values.

### Specifying Columns Explicitly

To avoid relying on the order of the columns in the table, you can specify the columns explicitly:

```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, price, product_no) VALUES ('Cheese', 9.99, 1);
```

This will have the same effect as the previous example.

### Omitting Columns

If you don't have values for all the columns, you can omit some of them. In that case, the columns will be filled with their default values:

```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_no, name) VALUES (1, 'Cheese');
```

Alternatively, you can use the `DEFAULT` keyword to specify default values explicitly:

```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_no, name, price) VALUES (1, 'Cheese', DEFAULT);
```

### Inserting Multiple Rows

You can insert multiple rows in a single command:

```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_no, name, price) VALUES
    (1, 'Cheese', 9.99),
    (2, 'Bread', 1.99),
    (3, 'Milk', 2.99);
```

### Inserting the Result of a Query

You can also insert the result of a query into a table:

```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_no, name, price)
  SELECT product_no, name, price FROM new_products
    WHERE release_date = 'today';
```

This provides the full power of the SQL query mechanism for computing the rows to be inserted.

### Tip

When inserting a large amount of data at the same time, consider using the `COPY` command. It is not as flexible as the `INSERT` command, but is more efficient. Refer to Section 14.4 for more information on improving bulk loading performance.

### Usage

Here's an example of inserting data into a database using Python and the `psycopg2` library:

```python
import psycopg2

# Connect to the database
conn = psycopg2.connect(
    dbname="mydatabase",
    user="myuser",
    password="mypassword",
    host="localhost",
    port="5432"
)

# Create a cursor object
cur = conn.cursor()

# Insert data into the products table
cur.execute("""
    INSERT INTO products (product_no, name, price) VALUES
        (1, 'Cheese', 9.99),
        (2, 'Bread', 1.99),
        (3, 'Milk', 2.99);
""")

# Commit the changes
conn.commit()

# Close the cursor and connection
cur.close()
conn.close()
```

This code connects to a PostgreSQL database, creates a cursor object, inserts data into the `products` table, and commits the changes. Finally, it closes the cursor and connection.
