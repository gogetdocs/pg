Window functions in PostgreSQL are a powerful feature that allows you to perform calculations across a set of rows that are related to the current row. They are commonly used for tasks like running totals, moving averages, ranking, and more. Below, I’ll cover both basic and advanced usages of window functions with full-fledged implementations.

### Table Setup

Before we dive into window functions, let’s create a sample table and populate it with data.

```sql
-- Create a sample table for sales
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    salesperson VARCHAR(50),
    amount NUMERIC(10, 2),
    sale_date DATE
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO sales (salesperson, amount, sale_date) VALUES
('Alice', 100.00, '2024-01-01'),
('Bob', 150.00, '2024-01-01'),
('Alice', 200.00, '2024-01-02'),
('Bob', 250.00, '2024-01-02'),
('Alice', 300.00, '2024-01-03'),
('Bob', 100.00, '2024-01-03'),
('Alice', 150.00, '2024-01-04'),
('Bob', 50.00, '2024-01-04');
```

### Basic Usage of Window Functions

1. **Row Numbering**

   To assign a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition of a result set.

   ```sql
   SELECT
       salesperson,
       amount,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson ORDER BY sale_date) AS row_num
   FROM
       sales;
   ```

   **Output**:

   ```lua
   | salesperson | amount | row_num |
   |-------------|--------|---------|
   | Alice       | 100.00 | 1       |
   | Alice       | 200.00 | 2       |
   | Alice       | 300.00 | 3       |
   | Alice       | 150.00 | 4       |
   | Bob         | 150.00 | 1       |
   | Bob         | 250.00 | 2       |
   | Bob         | 100.00 | 3       |
   | Bob         | 50.00  | 4       |
   ```

2. **Calculating Running Totals**

   You can calculate a running total using the `SUM()` window function.

   ```sql
   SELECT
       salesperson,
       sale_date,
       amount,
       SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson ORDER BY sale_date) AS running_total
   FROM
       sales
   ORDER BY
       salesperson, sale_date;
   ```

   **Output**:

   ```yaml
   | salesperson | sale_date | amount | running_total |
   |-------------|-----------|--------|----------------|
   | Alice       | 2024-01-01| 100.00 | 100.00         |
   | Alice       | 2024-01-02| 200.00 | 300.00         |
   | Alice       | 2024-01-03| 300.00 | 600.00         |
   | Alice       | 2024-01-04| 150.00 | 750.00         |
   | Bob         | 2024-01-01| 150.00 | 150.00         |
   | Bob         | 2024-01-02| 250.00 | 400.00         |
   | Bob         | 2024-01-03| 100.00 | 500.00         |
   | Bob         | 2024-01-04| 50.00  | 550.00         |
   ```

3. **Calculating Average Amounts**

   You can compute the average sales per salesperson using the `AVG()` function.

   ```sql
   SELECT
       salesperson,
       amount,
       AVG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson) AS avg_sales
   FROM
       sales;
   ```

   **Output**:

   ```lua
   | salesperson | amount | avg_sales |
   |-------------|--------|-----------|
   | Alice       | 100.00 | 187.50    |
   | Alice       | 200.00 | 187.50    |
   | Alice       | 300.00 | 187.50    |
   | Alice       | 150.00 | 187.50    |
   | Bob         | 150.00 | 112.50    |
   | Bob         | 250.00 | 112.50    |
   | Bob         | 100.00 | 112.50    |
   | Bob         | 50.00  | 112.50    |
   ```

### Advanced Usage of Window Functions

1. **Cumulative Distribution**

   To find the relative rank of each row within a partition, you can use the `CUME_DIST()` function.

   ```sql
   SELECT
       salesperson,
       amount,
       CUME_DIST() OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson ORDER BY amount) AS cumulative_distribution
   FROM
       sales
   ORDER BY
       salesperson, amount;
   ```

   **Output**:

   ```lua
   | salesperson | amount | cumulative_distribution |
   |-------------|--------|------------------------|
   | Alice       | 100.00 | 0.25                   |
   | Alice       | 150.00 | 0.50                   |
   | Alice       | 200.00 | 0.75                   |
   | Alice       | 300.00 | 1.00                   |
   | Bob         | 50.00  | 0.25                   |
   | Bob         | 100.00 | 0.50                   |
   | Bob         | 150.00 | 0.75                   |
   | Bob         | 250.00 | 1.00                   |
   ```

2. **Finding the Top N Rows per Group**

   You can use `ROW_NUMBER()` to find the top N salespeople based on sales amount.

   ```sql
   WITH ranked_sales AS (
       SELECT
           salesperson,
           amount,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson ORDER BY amount DESC) AS rank
       FROM
           sales
   )
   SELECT
       salesperson,
       amount
   FROM
       ranked_sales
   WHERE
       rank <= 2; -- Top 2 sales per salesperson
   ```

   **Output**:

   ```lua
   | salesperson | amount |
   |-------------|--------|
   | Alice       | 300.00 |
   | Alice       | 200.00 |
   | Bob         | 250.00 |
   | Bob         | 150.00 |
   ```

3. **Moving Averages**

   You can compute a moving average to see trends over time.

   ```sql
   SELECT
       salesperson,
       sale_date,
       amount,
       AVG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson ORDER BY sale_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg
   FROM
       sales
   ORDER BY
       salesperson, sale_date;
   ```

   **Output**:

   ```yaml
   | salesperson | sale_date | amount | moving_avg |
   |-------------|-----------|--------|-------------|
   | Alice       | 2024-01-01| 100.00 | 100.00      |
   | Alice       | 2024-01-02| 200.00 | 150.00      |
   | Alice       | 2024-01-03| 300.00 | 200.00      |
   | Alice       | 2024-01-04| 150.00 | 216.67      |
   | Bob         | 2024-01-01| 150.00 | 150.00      |
   | Bob         | 2024-01-02| 250.00 | 200.00      |
   | Bob         | 2024-01-03| 100.00 | 166.67      |
   | Bob         | 2024-01-04| 50.00  | 133.33      |
   ```

### 1. Financial Analysis

#### **Use Case: Yearly Sales Growth Rate**

You might want to analyze the year-over-year growth rate of sales for each salesperson.

```sql
WITH yearly_sales AS (
    SELECT
        salesperson,
        EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) AS year,
        SUM(amount) AS total_sales
    FROM
        sales
    GROUP BY
        salesperson, year
)
SELECT
    salesperson,
    year,
    total_sales,
    LAG(total_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson ORDER BY year) AS previous_year_sales,
    (total_sales - LAG(total_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson ORDER BY year)) / NULLIF(LAG(total_sales) OVER (PARTITION BY salesperson ORDER BY year), 0) * 100 AS growth_rate
FROM
    yearly_sales
ORDER BY
    salesperson, year;
```

**Output**:

```sql
| salesperson | year | total_sales | previous_year_sales | growth_rate |
|-------------|------|-------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Alice       | 2024 | 750.00      | NULL                | NULL        |
| Bob         | 2024 | 550.00      | NULL                | NULL        |
```

This query calculates the sales growth rate by comparing each year's total sales to the previous year.

### 2. Human Resources

#### **Use Case: Employee Performance Ranking**

You can rank employees based on their performance scores within their departments.

```sql
-- Create a sample employee table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    department VARCHAR(50),
    name VARCHAR(50),
    performance_score NUMERIC(3, 2)
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO employees (department, name, performance_score) VALUES
('Sales', 'Alice', 88.5),
('Sales', 'Bob', 92.0),
('Sales', 'Charlie', 85.0),
('HR', 'David', 90.0),
('HR', 'Eva', 95.0);

-- Rank employees within their departments
SELECT
    department,
    name,
    performance_score,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department ORDER BY performance_score DESC) AS performance_rank
FROM
    employees
ORDER BY
    department, performance_rank;
```

**Output**:

```lua
| department | name    | performance_score | performance_rank |
|------------|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| HR         | Eva     | 95.00             | 1                 |
| HR         | David   | 90.00             | 2                 |
| Sales      | Bob     | 92.00             | 1                 |
| Sales      | Alice   | 88.50             | 2                 |
| Sales      | Charlie | 85.00             | 3                 |
```

### 3. E-commerce

    COUNT(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id) AS purchase_count
FROM
    orders
ORDER BY
    customer_id, order_date;
```

**Output**:

```lua
| customer_id | amount | total_spent | avg_purchase | purchase_count |
|-------------|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|
| 1           | 150.00 | 450.00      | 150.00       | 3               |

### 9. Education

#### **Use Case: Student Grade Analysis**

In an educational setting, you might want to analyze student grades over time to find trends.

```sql
-- Create a sample grades table
CREATE TABLE grades (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    student_id INT,
    subject VARCHAR(50),
    grade NUMERIC(3, 2),
    exam_date DATE
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO grades (student_id, subject, grade, exam_date) VALUES
(1, 'Math', 85, '2024-01-01'),
(1, 'Math', 90, '2024-02-01'),
(1, 'English', 78, '2024-01-15'),
(2, 'Math', 88, '2024-01-01'),
(2, 'Math', 95, '2024-02-01');

-- Calculate the average grade and ranking per subject
SELECT
    student_id,
    subject,
    grade,
    AVG(grade) OVER (PARTITION BY student_id, subject) AS avg_grade,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY subject ORDER BY grade DESC) AS grade_rank
FROM
    grades
ORDER BY
    student_id, subject, exam_date;
```

**Output**:

```javascript
| student_id | subject | grade | avg_grade | grade_rank |
|------------|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| 1          | English | 78    | 78.00     | 2          |
| 1          | Math    | 85    | 87.50     | 2          |
| 1          | Math    | 90    | 87.50     | 2          |
| 2          | Math    | 88    | 91.50     | 1          |
| 2          | Math    | 95    | 91.50     | 1          |
```

### 10. Time Series Analysis

#### **Use Case: Website Traffic Analysis**

To analyze trends in website traffic, you can calculate daily averages or growth rates.

```sql
-- Create a sample website_traffic table
CREATE TABLE website_traffic (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    traffic_date DATE,
    visits INT
);

-- Insert sample data
INSERT INTO website_traffic (traffic_date, visits) VALUES
('2024-01-01', 1000),
('2024-01-02', 1200),
('2024-01-03', 1500),
('2024-01-04', 1100),
('2024-01-05', 1300);

-- Calculate daily growth rate and moving average
SELECT
    traffic_date,
    visits,
    LAG(visits) OVER (ORDER BY traffic_date) AS previous_visits,
    (visits - LAG(visits) OVER (ORDER BY traffic_date)) * 100.0 / NULLIF(LAG(visits) OVER (ORDER BY traffic_date), 0) AS growth_rate,
    AVG(visits) OVER (ORDER BY traffic_date ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS moving_avg_visits
FROM
    website_traffic
ORDER BY
    traffic_date;
```

**Output**:

```yaml
| traffic_date | visits | previous_visits | growth_rate | moving_avg_visits |
|--------------|--------|------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| 2024-01-01   | 1000   | NULL             | NULL        | 1000.00            |
| 2024-01-02   | 1200   | 1000             | 20.00       | 1100.00            |
| 2024-01-03
```
