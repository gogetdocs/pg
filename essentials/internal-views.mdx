### **3. `pg_stat_statements` View**

This view provides performance-related information about SQL queries executed in the database, such as execution times and I/O statistics.

#### **a. Query Execution Statistics**

```sql
-- View statistics on query execution from pg_stat_statements
SELECT query, calls, total_time, min_time, max_time, mean_time, rows
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

- `query`: SQL query text.
- `calls`: Number of times the query was executed.
- `total_time`: Total time spent on the query (in milliseconds).
- `min_time`: Minimum execution time.
- `max_time`: Maximum execution time.
- `mean_time`: Average execution time.
- `rows`: Number of rows processed by the query.

### **4. `pg_locks` View**

This view provides information about locks that are currently held or requested by transactions.

#### **a. View Active Locks**

       b.pid AS blocking_pid, b.mode AS blocking_mode
FROM pg_locks a
JOIN pg_locks b
  ON a.locktype = b.locktype
  AND a.database = b.database
  AND a.relation = b.relation
  AND a.granted = false
  AND b.granted = true
  AND a.pid != b.pid;
```
