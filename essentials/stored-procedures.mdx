Stored procedures in PostgreSQL allow you to encapsulate business logic on the database side, making it possible to perform complex operations efficiently and securely. In PostgreSQL 11+, stored procedures (`CREATE PROCEDURE`) have been introduced, which differ from functions (`CREATE FUNCTION`) in that they can manage transactions. Unlike functions, procedures can commit and roll back transactions.

Here is a full-fledged guide with all possibilities for using stored procedures in PostgreSQL, including examples:

### 1. **Creating Simple Stored Procedure**

A simple stored procedure that doesn't accept arguments or return values.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE simple_procedure()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'This is a simple procedure without parameters.';
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL simple_procedure();
```

### 2. **Procedure with Input Parameters**

A procedure that takes input parameters.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE greet_person(name TEXT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'Hello, %!', name;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL greet_person('Alice');
```

### 3. **Procedure with Output Parameters (Using OUT Parameter)**

PostgreSQL stored procedures do not have a `RETURN` clause like functions, but you can simulate output using `OUT` parameters.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE get_product_details(IN product_id INT, OUT product_name TEXT, OUT product_price NUMERIC)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    SELECT name, price INTO product_name, product_price
    FROM products
    WHERE id = product_id;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL get_product_details(1, product_name, product_price);
-- The output parameters 'product_name' and 'product_price' will be filled with the procedure's results.
```

### 4. **Procedure with Transactions**

A key feature of stored procedures is the ability to control transactions (`COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`). This is not possible with functions.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE transfer_funds(from_account INT, to_account INT, amount NUMERIC)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Begin transaction manually (implicit with CALL)
    BEGIN
        -- Deduct from sender
        UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - amount WHERE account_id = from_account;

        -- Simulate error if balance goes negative
        IF (SELECT balance FROM accounts WHERE account_id = from_account) < 0 THEN
            RAISE EXCEPTION 'Insufficient funds in account %', from_account;
        END IF;

        -- Add to receiver
        UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + amount WHERE account_id = to_account;
    EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS THEN
        -- Roll back transaction in case of error
        ROLLBACK;
        RAISE;
    END;
    -- Commit transaction explicitly
    COMMIT;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL transfer_funds(1, 2, 100.00);
```

### 5. **Procedure with Cursors**

You can use cursors in stored procedures to iterate over query results.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE iterate_customers()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    customer_rec RECORD;
    cur CURSOR FOR SELECT id, name FROM customers;
BEGIN
    OPEN cur;

    LOOP
        FETCH cur INTO customer_rec;
        EXIT WHEN NOT FOUND;

        -- Do something with each customer
        RAISE NOTICE 'Customer ID: %, Name: %', customer_rec.id, customer_rec.name;
    END LOOP;

    CLOSE cur;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL iterate_customers();
```

### 6. **Procedure with Dynamic SQL (Using `EXECUTE`)**

Dynamic SQL is useful when the SQL query or table is determined at runtime.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE dynamic_query(query TEXT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    EXECUTE query;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL dynamic_query('SELECT * FROM customers WHERE id = 1');
```

### 7. **Procedure with Control Structures**

Stored procedures in PostgreSQL can include control structures like loops and conditionals.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE update_customers_discount()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    customer_rec RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR customer_rec IN SELECT id, total_spent FROM customers LOOP
        IF customer_rec.total_spent > 1000 THEN
            UPDATE customers SET discount = 0.1 WHERE id = customer_rec.id;
        ELSIF customer_rec.total_spent > 500 THEN
            UPDATE customers SET discount = 0.05 WHERE id = customer_rec.id;
        ELSE
            UPDATE customers SET discount = 0 WHERE id = customer_rec.id;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL update_customers_discount();
```

### 8. **Procedure with Exception Handling**

You can catch and handle exceptions in stored procedures using `EXCEPTION`.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE safe_divide(a INT, b INT, OUT result INT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    BEGIN
        result := a / b;
    EXCEPTION WHEN division_by_zero THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Division by zero is not allowed.';
        result := NULL;
    END;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL safe_divide(10, 0, result);
```

### 9. **Procedure with Multiple OUT Parameters**

You can return multiple output parameters in a procedure, mimicking returning a row.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE get_user_info(IN user_id INT, OUT name TEXT, OUT email TEXT, OUT signup_date DATE)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    SELECT username, email, created_at
    INTO name, email, signup_date
    FROM users
    WHERE id = user_id;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL get_user_info(5, name, email, signup_date);
```

### 10. **Procedure with Loops**

Looping through rows in a table using a cursor.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE print_users()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    cur_user RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR cur_user IN SELECT id, username FROM users LOOP
        RAISE NOTICE 'User: %', cur_user.username;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL print_users();
```

### 11. **Procedure that Modifies Table Data**

Stored procedures are often used to perform data modifications.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE update_employee_salary(employee_id INT, new_salary NUMERIC)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE employees SET salary = new_salary WHERE id = employee_id;
    IF NOT FOUND THEN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Employee not found with ID %', employee_id;
    END IF;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL update_employee_salary(101, 55000.00);
```

### 12. **Procedure with Temporary Tables**

Stored procedures can create and manipulate temporary tables.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE create_temp_table()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_employees (id INT, name TEXT);
    INSERT INTO temp_employees VALUES (1, 'Alice'), (2, 'Bob');

    RAISE NOTICE 'Temporary table created and populated.';
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL create_temp_table();
```

### 13. **Dropping a Stored Procedure**

When you no longer need a procedure, you can drop it.

```sql
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS simple_procedure;
```

### 14. **Procedure with Security Definer**

You can create a procedure that runs with the privileges of the user who defined it, not the caller, by using `SECURITY DEFINER`.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE secure_update()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
SECURITY DEFINER
AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE sensitive_data SET value = value + 1;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL secure_update();
```

CREATE PROCEDURE update_customer_preferences(customer_id INT, preferences JSONB)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE customers SET preferences = preferences || preferences
    WHERE id = customer_id;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL update_customer_preferences(1, '{"newsletter": true}');
```

### 20. **Validating Data Before Insert**

You can create a procedure that validates data before inserting it into a table.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE insert_new_product(name TEXT, price NUMERIC)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    IF price < 0 THEN
        RAISE EXCEPTION 'Price cannot be negative';
    END IF;

    INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES (name, price);
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL insert_new_product('New Product', 99.99);
```

### 21. **Chaining Procedures**

You can call one procedure from another, allowing for modular code design.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE calculate_discount(customer_id INT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    discount NUMERIC;
BEGIN
    -- Call another procedure to get customer data
    CALL get_customer_discount(customer_id, discount);

    RAISE NOTICE 'Discount for customer % is %', customer_id, discount;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL calculate_discount(1);
```

### 22. **Implementing a Log Table**

Use stored procedures to implement logging functionality, tracking changes made to important tables.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE log_change(action TEXT, table_name TEXT, changed_data JSONB)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO change_log (action, table_name, changed_data, changed_at)
    VALUES (action, table_name, changed_data, NOW());
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL log_change('UPDATE', 'customers', '{"id": 1, "name": "John Doe"}');
```

### 23. **Recursive Procedures**

Stored procedures can also implement recursive logic for hierarchical data.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE get_subordinates(employee_id INT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    sub_id INT;
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'Subordinates of employee %:', employee_id;

    FOR sub_id IN SELECT id FROM employees WHERE manager_id = employee_id LOOP
        RAISE NOTICE 'Subordinate ID: %', sub_id;
        -- Recursively call this procedure to get subordinates of the subordinates
        CALL get_subordinates(sub_id);
    END LOOP;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL get_subordinates(1);
```

### 24. **Creating a Custom Report**

Stored procedures can generate custom reports by aggregating and formatting data.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE generate_sales_report(start_date DATE, end_date DATE)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    rec RECORD;
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'Sales report from % to %:', start_date, end_date;

    FOR rec IN SELECT product_id, SUM(amount) as total_sales FROM sales
                WHERE sale_date BETWEEN start_date AND end_date
                GROUP BY product_id LOOP
        RAISE NOTICE 'Product ID: %, Total Sales: %', rec.product_id, rec.total_sales;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL generate_sales_report('2024-01-01', '2024-12-31');
```

### 25. **Data Migration**

Stored procedures can facilitate data migration between tables or databases.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE migrate_data()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO new_table (col1, col2)
    SELECT col1, col2 FROM old_table;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Data migration completed successfully.';
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL migrate_data();
```

### 26. **Integration with External Systems**

Stored procedures can call external services or systems, provided you have the necessary permissions and configurations.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE notify_admins(issue TEXT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    -- Assuming there's a function to send notifications
    PERFORM send_notification('admin@example.com', issue);
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL notify_admins('Database backup failed.');
```

### 27. **Email Notification**

If configured properly, you can use procedures to send email notifications.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE send_email(to_email TEXT, subject TEXT, body TEXT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    PERFORM pg_send_email(to_email, subject, body);
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL send_email('user@example.com', 'Welcome!', 'Thanks for signing up.');
```

### 28. **Creating User Roles**

Stored procedures can manage user roles and permissions within the database.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE create_user_role(role_name TEXT)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    EXECUTE format('CREATE ROLE %I', role_name);
    RAISE NOTICE 'Role % created.', role_name;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL create_user_role('new_user_role');
```

### 29. **Aggregating Data from Multiple Tables**

Stored procedures can aggregate data from multiple tables for complex reporting needs.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE get_customer_orders_summary(IN customer_id INT, OUT total_orders INT, OUT total_amount NUMERIC)
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(amount)
    INTO total_orders, total_amount
    FROM orders
    WHERE customer_id = customer_id;
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL get_customer_orders_summary(1, total_orders, total_amount);
```

### 30. **Automated Data Refresh**

You can create a stored procedure that refreshes materialized views.

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE refresh_materialized_views()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW sales_summary;
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW customer_activity;
    RAISE NOTICE 'Materialized views refreshed.';
END;
$$;
```

**Usage:**

```sql
CALL refresh_materialized_views();
```
