PostgreSQL is a powerful relational database management system that provides a wide variety of built-in functions and features. Below, I’ll provide a comprehensive overview of basic and advanced usages of some key built-in functionalities in PostgreSQL.

### 1. Data Types

PostgreSQL supports several data types, including but not limited to:

- Numeric types (e.g., `INTEGER`, `NUMERIC`)
- Character types (e.g., `VARCHAR`, `TEXT`)
- Date/Time types (e.g., `DATE`, `TIMESTAMP`)
- Boolean types (e.g., `BOOLEAN`)
- JSON/JSONB types
- Arrays

#### Basic Usage

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    hired_on DATE,
    salary NUMERIC(10, 2)
);
```

#### Advanced Usage

- **Using JSONB for Document Storage:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    details JSONB
);

INSERT INTO products (name, details) VALUES
('Laptop', '{"brand": "Dell", "specs": {"ram": "16GB", "cpu": "i7"}}');
```

### 2. Functions

PostgreSQL provides a wide range of built-in functions for different purposes.

#### Basic Usage

- **String Functions:**

```sql
SELECT UPPER(name) AS upper_name FROM employees;
SELECT LENGTH(name) AS name_length FROM employees;
```

- **Aggregate Functions:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(salary) FROM employees;
```

#### Advanced Usage

- **Custom Aggregate Functions:**

```sql
CREATE AGGREGATE my_avg (
    SFUNC = float8_avg,
    STYPE = float8
);
```

### 3. Operators

PostgreSQL supports a variety of operators including arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.

#### Basic Usage

- **Arithmetic Operators:**

```sql
SELECT age + 5 AS age_next_year FROM employees;
```

- **Comparison Operators:**

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;
```

#### Advanced Usage

- **Array Operators:**

```sql
SELECT unnest(ARRAY[1, 2, 3]) AS number;
SELECT ARRAY[1, 2, 3] || ARRAY[4, 5] AS combined_array;
```

### 4. Window Functions

Window functions allow you to perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.

#### Basic Usage

```sql
SELECT name, salary,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC) AS salary_rank
FROM employees;
```

#### Advanced Usage

- **Cumulative Sum:**

```sql
SELECT name, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY hired_on) AS cumulative_salary
FROM employees;
```

### 5. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs provide a way to write more readable queries by breaking them into simpler parts.

#### Basic Usage

```sql
WITH employee_salaries AS (
    SELECT name, salary FROM employees
)
SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employee_salaries;
```

#### Advanced Usage

- **Recursive CTE:**

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE numbers AS (
    SELECT 1 AS num
    UNION ALL
    SELECT num + 1 FROM numbers WHERE num < 10
)
SELECT * FROM numbers;
```

### 6. Triggers

Triggers allow you to execute a function automatically in response to certain events on a table.

#### Basic Usage

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION update_timestamp()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.updated_at = NOW();
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER update_employee_timestamp
BEFORE UPDATE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION update_timestamp();
```

#### Advanced Usage

- **Trigger for Auditing:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee_audit (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_id INT,
    action VARCHAR(10),
    action_time TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE FUNCTION audit_employee()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO employee_audit(employee_id, action)
    VALUES (OLD.id, TG_OP);
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER audit_employee_changes
AFTER UPDATE OR DELETE ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE FUNCTION audit_employee();
```

### 7. Indexes

Indexes improve the performance of queries by allowing faster data retrieval.

#### Basic Usage

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_employee_name ON employees(name);
```

#### Advanced Usage

- **Partial Indexes:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_high_salary ON employees(salary) WHERE salary > 100000;
```

- **GIN Index for JSONB:**

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_gin_details ON products USING GIN (details);
```

### 8. Full-Text Search

PostgreSQL provides powerful full-text search capabilities.

#### Basic Usage

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE to_tsvector(name) @@ to_tsquery('laptop');
```

#### Advanced Usage

- **Configuring Text Search:**

```sql
CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION myconfig (COPY = pg_catalog.english);
ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION myconfig
ALTER MAPPING FOR asciiword, asciihword, hword, hword_part
WITH simple;
```

### 9. Transactions

PostgreSQL supports transactions, allowing you to execute a set of commands as a single unit of work.

#### Basic Usage

```sql
BEGIN;

INSERT INTO employees (name, age, hired_on, salary)
VALUES ('John Doe', 30, '2024-01-01', 60000);

COMMIT;
```

#### Advanced Usage

- **Savepoints:**

```sql
BEGIN;

INSERT INTO employees (name, age) VALUES ('Jane Doe', 25);
SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;

INSERT INTO employees (name, age) VALUES ('Invalid Employee', NULL);
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;

COMMIT;
```

### 10. Materialized Views

Materialized views store the result of a query physically, allowing for quicker access to data.

#### Basic Usage

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_employee_salaries AS
SELECT name, salary FROM employees;
```

#### Advanced Usage

- **Refreshing Materialized Views:**

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_employee_salaries;
```

    price NUMERIC(10, 2),
    stock_quantity INT
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT REFERENCES customers(id),
    order_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
    total_amount NUMERIC(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT REFERENCES orders(id),
    product_id INT REFERENCES products(id),

    DATE_TRUNC('month', transaction_date) AS month,
    SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'credit' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS total_credits,
    SUM(CASE WHEN transaction_type = 'debit' THEN amount ELSE 0 END) AS total_debits
FROM transactions
GROUP BY month;
```
