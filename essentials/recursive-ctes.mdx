Recursive Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in PostgreSQL are a powerful feature for working with hierarchical data or performing tasks that require recursive processing. Below are some complete implementations of recursive CTEs in scenarios, including examples.

### 1. **Hierarchical Data Representation**

One of the most common uses of recursive CTEs is to represent hierarchical data, such as organizational charts or category trees.

#### Example: Employee Hierarchy

Consider a table `employees` that has a structure to represent employees and their managers:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    manager_id INT REFERENCES employees(id)
);

INSERT INTO employees (name, manager_id) VALUES
('Alice', NULL),
('Bob', 1),
('Charlie', 1),
('David', 2),
('Eve', 2),
('Frank', 3);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Retrieve the Hierarchy

This CTE retrieves the hierarchy of employees starting from a specific employee (e.g., Alice):

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT id, name, manager_id, 0 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE name = 'Alice'  -- Starting point

    UNION ALL

    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;
```

**Explanation:**

- The first part of the CTE selects the starting employee (Alice) and initializes the `level` to 0.
- The second part joins the `employees` table with the CTE itself to find all employees managed by the current level and increments the level.
- The final SELECT retrieves all records from the CTE.

### 2. **Path Finding in Graphs**

Another practical application is finding paths in graph-like structures, such as in social networks or dependency trees.

#### Example: Graph Path Finding

Assume we have a table `connections` that describes relationships between nodes:

```sql
CREATE TABLE connections (
    source INT,
    target INT
);

INSERT INTO connections (source, target) VALUES
(1, 2),
(1, 3),
(2, 4),
(2, 5),
(3, 6),
(4, 7),
(5, 8);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Find All Paths from a Node

This CTE finds all paths starting from node 1:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE paths AS (
    SELECT source, target, ARRAY[target] AS path
    FROM connections
    WHERE source = 1  -- Starting point

    UNION ALL

    SELECT c.source, c.target, p.path || c.target
    FROM connections c
    JOIN paths p ON c.source = p.target
)
SELECT * FROM paths;
```

**Explanation:**

- The first part selects direct connections from the starting node.
- The second part recursively joins to find further connections and appends them to the current path using the `ARRAY` data type.
- The final SELECT retrieves all paths found.

### 3. **Fibonacci Sequence Generation**

Recursive CTEs can also be used for generating sequences, such as the Fibonacci sequence.

#### Example: Generating Fibonacci Numbers

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE fibonacci(n, fib) AS (
    SELECT 1, 0  -- First Fibonacci number (0)
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1, fib + (SELECT fib FROM fibonacci WHERE n = fibonacci.n - 1)
    FROM fibonacci
    WHERE n < 10  -- Generate first 10 Fibonacci numbers
)
SELECT * FROM fibonacci;
```

**Explanation:**

- The base case initializes the first Fibonacci number (0).
- The recursive case computes the next Fibonacci number by summing the last two computed values.
- The final SELECT retrieves the Fibonacci numbers generated.

### 4. **Bill of Materials**

A recursive CTE can be utilized to model a bill of materials where components may consist of other sub-components.

#### Example: Bill of Materials

Suppose you have a `parts` table that describes parts and their sub-parts:

```sql
CREATE TABLE parts (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    part_name VARCHAR(100),
    parent_id INT REFERENCES parts(id)
);

INSERT INTO parts (part_name, parent_id) VALUES
('Assembly', NULL),
('Part A', 1),
('Part B', 1),
('Sub-part A1', 2),
('Sub-part A2', 2),
('Sub-part B1', 3);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Retrieve Full Bill of Materials

To get the full list of components for an assembly:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE bill_of_materials AS (
    SELECT id, part_name, parent_id
    FROM parts
    WHERE part_name = 'Assembly'  -- Starting point

    UNION ALL

    SELECT p.id, p.part_name, p.parent_id
    FROM parts p
    INNER JOIN bill_of_materials bom ON p.parent_id = bom.id
)
SELECT * FROM bill_of_materials;
```

**Explanation:**

- The base query selects the main assembly.
- The recursive query joins to find all parts that belong to the current assembly level.
- The final SELECT retrieves the complete bill of materials.

---

### 5. **Finding Circular References**

In scenarios where relationships can be circular (like in organizational structures or dependency graphs), a recursive CTE can help identify such cycles.

#### Example: Detecting Circular Dependencies

Imagine a project management table that tracks tasks and their dependencies:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    task_name VARCHAR(100),
    depends_on INT REFERENCES tasks(id)
);

INSERT INTO tasks (task_name, depends_on) VALUES
('Task 1', NULL),
('Task 2', 1),
('Task 3', 2),
('Task 4', 3),
('Task 5', 2),
('Task 6', 4),
('Task 7', 3),
('Task 8', 1),
('Task 9', 8),
('Task 10', 9),
('Task 11', 3); -- Creates a circular reference with Task 3
```

#### Recursive CTE to Detect Cycles

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE task_dependencies AS (
    SELECT id, task_name, depends_on, ARRAY[id] AS path
    FROM tasks
    WHERE depends_on IS NULL  -- Start with root tasks

    UNION ALL

    SELECT t.id, t.task_name, t.depends_on, path || t.id
    FROM tasks t
    JOIN task_dependencies td ON t.depends_on = td.id
    WHERE NOT t.id = ANY(path)  -- Prevent cycles
)
SELECT * FROM task_dependencies
WHERE task_name = 'Task 3';  -- Check dependencies for Task 3
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE starts from tasks without dependencies.
- It checks if a task is already in the path to prevent cycles.
- The final SELECT queries dependencies for a specific task.

### 6. **Calculating Hierarchical Totals**

In financial applications, you might need to calculate totals for parent categories based on their subcategories.

#### Example: Product Categories

Assume you have a `categories` table representing a category hierarchy for products:

```sql
CREATE TABLE categories (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    category_name VARCHAR(100),
    parent_id INT REFERENCES categories(id),
    sales_amount NUMERIC
);

INSERT INTO categories (category_name, parent_id, sales_amount) VALUES
('Electronics', NULL, 0),
('Computers', 1, 0),
('Laptops', 2, 2000),
('Desktops', 2, 3000),
('Mobile Phones', 1, 5000);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Calculate Total Sales for Each Category

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE category_sales AS (
    SELECT id, category_name, sales_amount
    FROM categories
    WHERE parent_id IS NULL  -- Start from root categories

    UNION ALL

    SELECT c.id, c.category_name, cs.sales_amount + c.sales_amount
    FROM categories c
    JOIN category_sales cs ON c.parent_id = cs.id
)
SELECT category_name, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM category_sales
GROUP BY category_name;
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE initializes with root categories.
- It accumulates sales from subcategories as it traverses the hierarchy.
- The final SELECT sums up the total sales per category.

### 7. **Generating Date Series**

Recursive CTEs can be useful for generating sequences of dates for reporting purposes.

#### Example: Generating a Date Range

Suppose you want to generate a list of dates for the current month:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE date_series AS (
    SELECT CURRENT_DATE - (EXTRACT(DAY FROM CURRENT_DATE) - 1) AS date  -- First day of the month
    UNION ALL
    SELECT date + INTERVAL '1 day'
    FROM date_series
    WHERE date + INTERVAL '1 day' < CURRENT_DATE + INTERVAL '1 month'  -- Until the next month
)
SELECT * FROM date_series;
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE starts with the first day of the current month.
- It recursively adds one day until the next month is reached.
- The final SELECT retrieves all the generated dates.

### 8. **Social Network Friendships**

In social networks, recursive CTEs can be used to find friends of friends (2nd-degree connections).

#### Example: Social Network Connections

Suppose you have a `friends` table representing relationships:

```sql
CREATE TABLE friends (
    user_id INT,
    friend_id INT
);

INSERT INTO friends (user_id, friend_id) VALUES
(1, 2),
(1, 3),
(2, 4),
(2, 5),
(3, 6),
(4, 7),
(5, 1),  -- Creates a circular reference
(6, 1);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Find Friends of Friends

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE friend_circle AS (
    SELECT user_id, friend_id
    FROM friends
    WHERE user_id = 1  -- Starting user

    UNION ALL

    SELECT f.user_id, f.friend_id
    FROM friends f
    JOIN friend_circle fc ON f.user_id = fc.friend_id
)
SELECT DISTINCT friend_id
FROM friend_circle
WHERE friend_id != 1;  -- Exclude the starting user
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE starts with the immediate friends of user 1.
- It recursively joins to find friends of friends.
- The final SELECT retrieves distinct 2nd-degree connections.

### 9. **File System Navigation**

Recursive CTEs can model a file system where folders contain subfolders.

#### Example: File Structure

Suppose you have a `files` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE files (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    file_name VARCHAR(100),
    parent_id INT REFERENCES files(id)
);

INSERT INTO files (file_name, parent_id) VALUES
('root', NULL),
('folder1', 1),
('folder2', 1),
('file1.txt', 2),
('file2.txt', 2),
('subfolder1', 3),
('file3.txt', 6);
```

#### Recursive CTE to List All Files in a Folder

To list all files within a specific folder:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE file_structure AS (
    SELECT id, file_name
    FROM files
    WHERE file_name = 'folder1'  -- Starting point

    UNION ALL

    SELECT f.id, f.file_name
    FROM files f
    JOIN file_structure fs ON f.parent_id = fs.id
)
SELECT * FROM file_structure;
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE starts from the specified folder.
- It recursively joins to find all files and subfolders.
- The final SELECT retrieves the entire file structure.

### 10. **Tournament Bracket Generation**

In sports tournaments, a recursive CTE can be used to create a bracket structure based on match results.

#### Example: Tournament Matches

```sql
CREATE TABLE matches (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    round_number INT,
    match_id INT,
    winner_id INT
);

INSERT INTO matches (round_number, match_id, winner_id) VALUES
(1, 1, 1),
(1, 2, 2),
(2, 3, 1),
(2, 4, 2);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Generate Bracket

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE tournament_bracket AS (
    SELECT round_number, match_id, winner_id
    FROM matches
    WHERE round_number = 1  -- Starting with the first round

    UNION ALL

    SELECT m.round_number, m.match_id, m.winner_id
    FROM matches m
    JOIN tournament_bracket tb ON m.round_number = tb.round_number + 1
    WHERE tb.winner_id IN (m.match_id)
)
SELECT * FROM tournament_bracket;
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE starts from the first round of matches.
- It recursively joins to determine winners for subsequent rounds.
- The final SELECT retrieves the tournament bracket.

---

### 11. **Network Routing**

In networking, recursive CTEs can be used to find the shortest path or all possible paths in a network.

#### Example: Network Connections

Suppose you have a `network` table representing connections between devices:

```sql
CREATE TABLE network (
    device_id INT,
    connected_to INT
);

INSERT INTO network (device_id, connected_to) VALUES
(1, 2),
(1, 3),
(2, 4),
(3, 4),
(3, 5),
(4, 6);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Find All Paths from a Device

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE network_paths AS (
    SELECT device_id, connected_to, ARRAY[device_id, connected_to] AS path
    FROM network
    WHERE device_id = 1  -- Starting device

    UNION ALL

    SELECT n.device_id, n.connected_to, np.path || n.connected_to
    FROM network n
    JOIN network_paths np ON n.device_id = np.connected_to
    WHERE NOT n.connected_to = ANY(np.path)  -- Prevent cycles
)
SELECT * FROM network_paths;
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE starts with the specified device.
- It recursively joins to find all connected devices, avoiding cycles.
- The final SELECT retrieves all paths found.

### 12. **Organizational Chart with Levels**

You can represent an organizational chart while also showing the levels of hierarchy.

#### Example: Extended Employee Hierarchy

Using the earlier `employees` table:

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT id, name, manager_id, 0 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE name = 'Alice'  -- Starting employee

    UNION ALL

    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
)
SELECT id, name, level
FROM employee_hierarchy;
```

**Explanation:**

- This CTE not only retrieves employees but also calculates their level in the hierarchy.
- The final SELECT shows the employee name along with their level.

### 13. **Employee Salary Calculation**

You might want to calculate total salary expenditures for departments based on employee salary hierarchies.

#### Example: Employee Salaries

Assume you have a `salaries` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE salaries (
    employee_id INT,
    salary NUMERIC,
    manager_id INT REFERENCES employees(employee_id)
);

INSERT INTO salaries (employee_id, salary, manager_id) VALUES
(1, 100000, NULL),
(2, 60000, 1),
(3, 70000, 1),
(4, 50000, 2),
(5, 45000, 2),
(6, 55000, 3);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Calculate Total Salary by Department

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE salary_totals AS (
    SELECT employee_id, salary, manager_id
    FROM salaries
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL  -- Start with top management

    UNION ALL

    SELECT s.employee_id, s.salary, s.manager_id
    FROM salaries s
    JOIN salary_totals st ON s.manager_id = st.employee_id
)
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary
FROM salary_totals;
```

**Explanation:**

- This CTE computes total salary expenses for all employees under each manager.
- The final SELECT sums up the salaries.

### 14. **Multi-Level Marketing Structure**

In multi-level marketing (MLM) systems, recursive CTEs can track downline representatives.

#### Example: MLM Representatives

Suppose you have a table that tracks representatives and their sponsors:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mlm (
    representative_id INT,
    sponsor_id INT
);

INSERT INTO mlm (representative_id, sponsor_id) VALUES
(1, NULL),  -- Top-level sponsor
(2, 1),
(3, 1),
(4, 2),
(5, 2),
(6, 3);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Find All Downline Representatives

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE downline AS (
    SELECT representative_id, sponsor_id
    FROM mlm
    WHERE sponsor_id IS NULL  -- Start with the top-level sponsor

    UNION ALL

    SELECT m.representative_id, m.sponsor_id
    FROM mlm m
    JOIN downline d ON m.sponsor_id = d.representative_id
)
SELECT * FROM downline;
```

**Explanation:**

- This CTE starts with the top-level sponsor and retrieves all representatives under them.
- The final SELECT retrieves the full downline.

### 15. **Cumulative Sales Over Time**

In sales reporting, recursive CTEs can help calculate cumulative sales over time.

#### Example: Monthly Sales Data

Assume you have a `monthly_sales` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE monthly_sales (
    month DATE,
    sales_amount NUMERIC
);

INSERT INTO monthly_sales (month, sales_amount) VALUES
('2024-01-01', 1000),
('2024-02-01', 1500),
('2024-03-01', 2000),
('2024-04-01', 2500);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Calculate Cumulative Sales

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE cumulative_sales AS (
    SELECT month, sales_amount, sales_amount AS cumulative_amount
    FROM monthly_sales
    WHERE month = (SELECT MIN(month) FROM monthly_sales)  -- Start from the earliest month

    UNION ALL

    SELECT ms.month, ms.sales_amount, cs.cumulative_amount + ms.sales_amount
    FROM monthly_sales ms
    JOIN cumulative_sales cs ON ms.month = (SELECT MIN(month) FROM monthly_sales WHERE month > cs.month)
)
SELECT month, cumulative_amount
FROM cumulative_sales;
```

**Explanation:**

- This CTE calculates cumulative sales by adding current month sales to the previous cumulative amount.
- The final SELECT retrieves the month and cumulative sales amount.

### 16. **Family Tree Representation**

Recursive CTEs can be used to represent family relationships, showing descendants of a person.

#### Example: Family Relationships

Assuming you have a `family` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE family (
    person_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    parent_id INT REFERENCES family(person_id)
);

INSERT INTO family (name, parent_id) VALUES
('Grandparent', NULL),
('Parent', 1),
('Aunt', 1),
('Child', 2),
('Cousin', 3);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Retrieve Descendants

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE family_tree AS (
    SELECT person_id, name
    FROM family
    WHERE name = 'Grandparent'  -- Starting point

    UNION ALL

    SELECT f.person_id, f.name
    FROM family f
    JOIN family_tree ft ON f.parent_id = ft.person_id
)
SELECT * FROM family_tree;
```

**Explanation:**

- This CTE starts from a specified ancestor and retrieves all descendants.
- The final SELECT lists all family members related to the ancestor.

### 17. **Course Prerequisites**

In educational systems, recursive CTEs can represent course prerequisites.

#### Example: Course Prerequisites

Consider a `courses` table that lists courses and their prerequisites:

```sql
CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100),
    prerequisite_id INT REFERENCES courses(course_id)
);

INSERT INTO courses (course_name, prerequisite_id) VALUES
('Course A', NULL),
('Course B', 1),
('Course C', 2),
('Course D', 2);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Find All Prerequisites for a Course

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE course_prerequisites AS (
    SELECT course_id, course_name
    FROM courses
    WHERE course_name = 'Course C'  -- Starting course

    UNION ALL

    SELECT c.course_id, c.course_name
    FROM courses c
    JOIN course_prerequisites cp ON c.course_id = cp.prerequisite_id
)
SELECT * FROM course_prerequisites;
```

**Explanation:**

- This CTE starts with a specific course and retrieves all its prerequisites.
- The final SELECT lists the prerequisites needed for a particular course.

### 18. **Content Management Systems (CMS)**

Recursive CTEs can manage nested content structures, such as articles with categories and subcategories.

#### Example: Articles and Categories

Assuming you have a `categories` table related to articles:

```sql
CREATE TABLE categories (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    category_name VARCHAR(100),
    parent_id INT REFERENCES categories(id)
);

CREATE TABLE articles (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(100),
    category_id INT REFERENCES categories(id)
);

INSERT INTO categories (category_name, parent_id) VALUES
('Technology', NULL),
('Programming', 1),
('Web Development', 2),
('Databases', 2);

INSERT INTO articles (title, category_id) VALUES
('Intro to Web Development', 3),
('Understanding Databases', 4);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Retrieve Articles by Category

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE category_tree AS (
    SELECT id, category_name
    FROM categories
    WHERE category_name = 'Technology'  -- Starting category

    UNION ALL

    SELECT c.id, c.category_name
    FROM categories c
    JOIN category_tree ct ON c.parent_id = ct.id
)
SELECT a.title
FROM articles a
JOIN category_tree ct ON a.category_id = ct.id;
```

**Explanation:**

- This CTE retrieves all subcategories of a specified category.
- The final SELECT lists articles belonging to those categories.

### 19. **Weather Data Aggregation**

In meteorological analysis, recursive CTEs can summarize daily weather data into weekly reports.

#### Example: Daily Weather Data

Suppose you have a `weather` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE weather (
    date DATE,
    temperature NUMERIC,
    precipitation NUMERIC
);

INSERT INTO weather (date, temperature, precipitation) VALUES
('2024-10-01', 75, 0),
('2024-10-02', 70, 0),
('2024-10-03', 68, 0.2),
('2024-10-04', 72, 0),
('2024-10-05', 74, 0.5);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Aggregate Weekly Weather

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE weekly_weather AS (
    SELECT date, temperature, precipitation,
           DATE_TRUNC('week', date) AS week_start
    FROM weather
    WHERE date = '2024-10-01'  -- Starting date for the first week

    UNION ALL

    SELECT w.date, w.temperature, w.precipitation,
           DATE_TRUNC('week', w.date) AS week_start
    FROM weather w
    JOIN weekly_weather ww ON DATE_TRUNC('week', w.date) = ww.week_start
    WHERE w.date > ww.date  -- Include only future dates
)
SELECT week_start, AVG(temperature) AS avg_temperature, SUM(precipitation) AS total_precipitation
FROM weekly_weather
GROUP BY week_start;
```

**Explanation:**

- This CTE aggregates daily weather into weekly summaries.
- The final SELECT retrieves average temperatures and total precipitation for each week.

### 20. **Project Management Task Dependencies**

In project management, recursive CTEs can be used to visualize and manage task dependencies.

#### Example: Tasks with Dependencies

Assume a `tasks` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
    task_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    task_name VARCHAR(100),
    depends_on INT REFERENCES tasks(task_id)
);

INSERT INTO tasks (task_name, depends_on) VALUES
('Project Planning', NULL),
('Design', 1),
('Development', 2),
('Testing', 3),
('Deployment', 3);
```

#### Recursive CTE to List Tasks and Their Dependencies

    FROM tasks
    WHERE task_name = 'Project Planning'  -- Starting task

    UNION ALL

    SELECT t.task_id, t.task_name, t.depends_on
    FROM tasks t
    JOIN task_dependencies td ON t.depends_on = td.task_id
)
SELECT * FROM task_dependencies;
```

**Explanation:**

- This CTE starts from a specific task and retrieves all dependent tasks.
- The final SELECT lists all tasks along with their dependencies.

---

### 21. **Task Scheduling with Recurring Events**

Recursive CTEs can be used to generate a schedule for recurring events (like meetings or deadlines).

#### Example: Recurring Events

Suppose you have a `recurring_events` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE recurring_events (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    event_name VARCHAR(100),
    start_date DATE,
    recurrence_interval INTERVAL
);

INSERT INTO recurring_events (event_name, start_date, recurrence_interval) VALUES
('Weekly Team Meeting', '2024-10-01', '1 week'),
('Monthly Report Submission', '2024-10-01', '1 month');
```

#### Recursive CTE to Generate Event Dates

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE event_dates AS (
    SELECT id, event_name, start_date AS event_date, recurrence_interval
    FROM recurring_events

    UNION ALL

    SELECT e.id, e.event_name, ed.event_date + e.recurrence_interval, e.recurrence_interval
    FROM recurring_events e
    JOIN event_dates ed ON e.id = ed.id
    WHERE ed.event_date + e.recurrence_interval < '2025-01-01'  -- Limit to a specific end date
)
SELECT * FROM event_dates;
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE generates dates for recurring events based on their start date and recurrence interval.
- The final SELECT retrieves all occurrences until the specified end date.

### 22. **Finding Ancestry in Genealogy**

In genealogy applications, recursive CTEs can help trace ancestry by finding all ancestors of a given person.

#### Example: Ancestry Relationships

Assuming you have a `family_tree` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE family_tree (
    person_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    parent_id INT REFERENCES family_tree(person_id)
);

INSERT INTO family_tree (name, parent_id) VALUES
('Grandfather', NULL),
('Father', 1),
('Uncle', 1),
('Me', 2);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Trace Ancestry

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE ancestry AS (
    SELECT person_id, name
    FROM family_tree
    WHERE name = 'Me'  -- Starting point

    UNION ALL

    SELECT ft.person_id, ft.name
    FROM family_tree ft
    JOIN ancestry a ON ft.person_id = a.parent_id
)
SELECT * FROM ancestry;
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE traces all ancestors of the specified person.
- The final SELECT retrieves the names of all ancestors.

### 23. **Document Hierarchy Management**

Recursive CTEs can manage hierarchical document structures like folders and subfolders in a document management system.

#### Example: Document Folders

Assuming you have a `documents` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE documents (
    doc_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    doc_name VARCHAR(100),
    parent_id INT REFERENCES documents(doc_id)
);

INSERT INTO documents (doc_name, parent_id) VALUES
('Root Document', NULL),
('Folder 1', 1),
('Folder 2', 1),
('Document A', 2),
('Document B', 2),
('Document C', 3);
```

#### Recursive CTE to List Documents in a Folder

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE document_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT doc_id, doc_name
    FROM documents
    WHERE doc_name = 'Folder 1'  -- Starting folder

    UNION ALL

    SELECT d.doc_id, d.doc_name
    FROM documents d
    JOIN document_hierarchy dh ON d.parent_id = dh.doc_id
)
SELECT * FROM document_hierarchy;
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE retrieves all documents within a specified folder and its subfolders.
- The final SELECT lists all documents under the chosen folder.

### 24. **E-commerce Product Category Navigation**

In e-commerce systems, recursive CTEs can manage product categories and subcategories.

#### Example: Product Categories

Assuming you have a `product_categories` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE product_categories (
    category_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    category_name VARCHAR(100),
    parent_id INT REFERENCES product_categories(category_id)
);

INSERT INTO product_categories (category_name, parent_id) VALUES
('Electronics', NULL),
('Computers', 1),
('Laptops', 2),
('Desktops', 2),
('Mobile Phones', 1);
```

#### Recursive CTE to List All Categories

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE category_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT category_id, category_name
    FROM product_categories
    WHERE category_name = 'Electronics'  -- Starting category

    UNION ALL

    SELECT pc.category_id, pc.category_name
    FROM product_categories pc
    JOIN category_hierarchy ch ON pc.parent_id = ch.category_id
)
SELECT * FROM category_hierarchy;
```

**Explanation:**

- This CTE retrieves all product categories under the specified parent category.
- The final SELECT lists all related categories.

### 25. **Calculating Fibonacci Numbers**

Recursive CTEs can generate Fibonacci numbers, which can be useful in mathematical or algorithmic applications.

#### Example: Fibonacci Series

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE fibonacci AS (
    SELECT 0 AS n, 0 AS fib
    UNION ALL
    SELECT 1, 1
    UNION ALL
    SELECT n + 1, fib + (SELECT fib FROM fibonacci WHERE n = n - 1)
    FROM fibonacci
    WHERE n < 20  -- Limit to the first 20 Fibonacci numbers
)
SELECT fib FROM fibonacci;
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE initializes with the first two Fibonacci numbers and then generates the series recursively.
- The final SELECT retrieves the Fibonacci numbers generated.

### 26. **Game Level Progression**

In gaming applications, recursive CTEs can manage player levels and their dependencies or achievements.

#### Example: Game Levels

Assuming you have a `game_levels` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE game_levels (
    level_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    level_name VARCHAR(100),
    requires_level INT REFERENCES game_levels(level_id)
);

INSERT INTO game_levels (level_name, requires_level) VALUES
('Level 1', NULL),
('Level 2', 1),
('Level 3', 2),
('Level 4', 3);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Retrieve Level Requirements

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE level_requirements AS (
    SELECT level_id, level_name
    FROM game_levels
    WHERE level_name = 'Level 4'  -- Starting level

    UNION ALL

    SELECT gl.level_id, gl.level_name
    FROM game_levels gl
    JOIN level_requirements lr ON gl.level_id = lr.requires_level
)
SELECT * FROM level_requirements;
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE retrieves all levels required to reach the specified starting level.
- The final SELECT lists the necessary levels.

### 27. **Dependency Graphs in Software Engineering**

In software engineering, recursive CTEs can model dependencies between software components or modules.

#### Example: Software Modules

Assuming you have a `modules` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE modules (
    module_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    module_name VARCHAR(100),
    depends_on INT REFERENCES modules(module_id)
);

INSERT INTO modules (module_name, depends_on) VALUES
('Core Module', NULL),
('Feature A', 1),
('Feature B', 2),
('Feature C', 1);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Find Module Dependencies

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE module_dependencies AS (
    SELECT module_id, module_name
    FROM modules
    WHERE module_name = 'Feature B'  -- Starting module

    UNION ALL

    SELECT m.module_id, m.module_name
    FROM modules m
    JOIN module_dependencies md ON m.depends_on = md.module_id
)
SELECT * FROM module_dependencies;
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE retrieves all dependencies of a specified module.
- The final SELECT lists the modules that must be loaded for the specified feature.

### 28. **Visualizing a Family Tree**

Recursive CTEs can visualize family relationships, showing both descendants and ancestors.

#### Example: Family Relationships

Assuming you have a `family` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE family (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    parent_id INT REFERENCES family(id)
);

INSERT INTO family (name, parent_id) VALUES
('Grandfather', NULL),
('Father', 1),
('Mother', 1),
('Me', 2),
('Brother', 2),
('Sister', 2);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Show Family Tree

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE family_tree AS (
    SELECT id, name, parent_id, 0 AS level
    FROM family
    WHERE name = 'Grandfather'  -- Starting ancestor

    UNION ALL

    SELECT f.id, f.name, f.parent_id, ft.level + 1
    FROM family f
    JOIN family_tree ft ON f.parent_id = ft.id
)
SELECT name, level
FROM family_tree
ORDER BY level;  -- Show the tree level
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE starts from a specified ancestor and retrieves all descendants, displaying their levels.
- The final SELECT lists all family members along with their respective levels in the tree.

### 29. **User Role Hierarchy**

In applications with user role management, recursive CTEs can manage and visualize role hierarchies.

#### Example: User Roles

Assuming you have a `roles` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE roles (
    role_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    role_name VARCHAR(100),
    parent_role INT REFERENCES roles(role_id)
);

INSERT INTO roles (role_name, parent_role) VALUES
('Admin', NULL),
('Manager', 1),
('Supervisor', 2),
('Employee', 2);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Retrieve Role Hierarchy

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE role_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT role_id, role_name
    FROM roles
    WHERE role_name = 'Admin'  -- Starting role

    UNION ALL

    SELECT r.role_id, r.role_name
    FROM roles r
    JOIN role_hierarchy rh ON r.parent_role = rh.role_id
)
SELECT * FROM role_hierarchy;
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE starts from a specified role and retrieves all roles under it.
- The final SELECT lists all roles in the hierarchy.

### 30. **Content Versioning in CMS**

In content management systems (CMS), recursive CTEs can track changes across content versions.

#### Example: Content Versions

Assuming you have a `content` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE content (
    version_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    content_text TEXT,
    previous_version INT REFERENCES content(version_id)
);

INSERT INTO content (content_text, previous_version) VALUES
('Initial version', NULL),
('Second version', 1),
('Third version', 2);
```

#### Recursive CTE to Retrieve All Versions of a Content Item

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE content_versions AS (
    SELECT version_id, content_text
    FROM content
    WHERE version_id = 3  -- Starting version

    UNION ALL

    SELECT c.version_id, c.content_text
    FROM content c
    JOIN content_versions cv ON c.version_id = cv.previous_version
)
SELECT * FROM content_versions;
```

**Explanation:**

- The CTE retrieves all versions of a content item based on its previous versions.
- The final SELECT lists the content across all versions.
