Indexing is a crucial aspect of PostgreSQL performance optimization. It helps speed up data retrieval operations, but it comes with trade-offs, such as increased storage requirements and potential overhead during data modification operations. Here’s a comprehensive overview of the types of indexes available in PostgreSQL, their usage scenarios, and best practices.

### Types of Indexes in PostgreSQL

1. **B-tree Indexes**

   - **Description**: Default index type. Suitable for most queries.
   - **Use Cases**: Equality (`=`), range queries (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`), sorting (`ORDER BY`), and `LIKE` queries without wildcards at the start.
   - **When to Use**: When you frequently perform searches on a column that has many distinct values.

2. **Hash Indexes**

   - **Description**: Uses a hash table. Only supports equality comparisons.
   - **Use Cases**: Use when you have frequent equality checks (e.g., `WHERE column = value`).
   - **Limitations**: Not suitable for range queries; not WAL-logged until PostgreSQL 10 (which means less durability).

3. **GiST (Generalized Search Tree) Indexes**

   - **Description**: Supports a variety of data types and queries, particularly useful for geometric data and full-text search.
   - **Use Cases**: Geospatial queries, full-text search, and any data requiring non-standard indexing.
   - **When to Use**: When dealing with complex data types (e.g., geometries, arrays) or full-text search.

4. **GIN (Generalized Inverted Index) Indexes**

   - **Description**: Useful for indexing composite types and arrays. More efficient than GiST for certain types of queries.
   - **Use Cases**: Full-text search, JSONB data type, and arrays.
   - **When to Use**: When you need to index array elements or JSONB attributes.

5. **SP-GiST (Space-Partitioned Generalized Search Tree) Indexes**

   - **Description**: Suitable for non-balanced data, supporting partitioning of data into non-overlapping regions.
   - **Use Cases**: Spatial data types, points, and geometries.
   - **When to Use**: When dealing with specific data distributions that aren’t well handled by B-tree or GiST.

6. **BRIN (Block Range INdexes)**

   - **Description**: Designed for large tables where data is naturally ordered. It stores metadata about block ranges.
   - **Use Cases**: Large datasets where you can take advantage of data locality (e.g., time series data).
   - **When to Use**: When dealing with very large tables with naturally sorted data.

7. **Covering Indexes**
   - **Description**: An index that contains all the columns needed for a query, eliminating the need to fetch rows from the table.
   - **Use Cases**: For queries that select specific columns.
   - **When to Use**: When the performance bottleneck is due to fetching rows from disk.

### Indexing Strategies

- **Single-Column vs. Multi-Column Indexes**: Use multi-column indexes when queries often filter by multiple columns. Ensure the columns are in the order of selectivity.
- **Partial Indexes**: Create an index only on a subset of data (e.g., `WHERE status = 'active'`). This can save space and improve performance.

- **Expression Indexes**: Index based on a computed expression rather than just a column (e.g., indexing on `LOWER(column_name)`).

- **Unique Indexes**: Enforce uniqueness constraints on a column. This can speed up lookups as well.

### When to Use Indexes

- **Read-Heavy Workloads**: If your application has a lot of read operations compared to writes, indexing is beneficial.

- **Frequent Search Queries**: When specific queries are executed often and they involve conditions on certain columns.

- **Join Operations**: Indexes can greatly improve the performance of join operations if the join keys are indexed.

- **Sorting and Grouping**: Use indexes when your queries frequently require sorting (`ORDER BY`) or grouping (`GROUP BY`).

### How to Create and Maintain Indexes

1. **Creating Indexes**

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name(column_name);
   CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_index_name ON table_name(column_name);
   CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name (column1, column2);
   CREATE INDEX index_name ON table_name USING GIN (jsonb_column jsonb_path_ops);
   ```

2. **Monitoring Index Usage**

   - Use `pg_stat_user_indexes` and `pg_stat_all_indexes` to see usage statistics.
   - Check for unused indexes to avoid unnecessary storage and maintenance costs.

3. **Reindexing**

   - Use `REINDEX` to rebuild an index if it has become bloated or corrupted.

   ```sql
   REINDEX INDEX index_name;
   REINDEX TABLE table_name;
   ```

4. **Dropping Unused Indexes**
   - If an index is not being used, consider dropping it to save space.
   ```sql
   DROP INDEX index_name;
   ```

### Performance Considerations

- **Index Bloat**: Over time, indexes can become bloated, leading to performance issues. Regular maintenance, such as `VACUUM`, is necessary.

- **Write Performance**: Every index incurs a cost on write operations (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`). Monitor performance closely.

- **Selectivity**: High selectivity indexes (many unique values) are generally more effective. Evaluate the distribution of your data.

- **Use the EXPLAIN Command**: To analyze how PostgreSQL uses indexes in query execution plans. This can help determine if an index is effective.

```

#### 7. **Covering Indexes**

- **Use Case**: Avoiding extra lookups by including all needed columns in the index.
- **Usage**: Create an index on multiple columns used in the query.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_users_full ON users(email, status);
```

- **Impact**: Allows the query to return results directly from the index without accessing the table.

```sql
SELECT email, status FROM users WHERE email = 'example@example.com';
```

#### 8. **Expression Indexes**

- **Use Case**: Indexing based on computed expressions.
- **Usage**: Create an index on an expression instead of a column.

```sql
SELECT * FROM my_table WHERE data @> '{"key": "value"}';
```

#### 11. **Spatial Indexing**

- **Use Case**: Optimizing geographic queries.
- **Usage**: Use GiST indexes for geometric data types.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_locations_geom ON locations USING GiST(geom);
```

- **Impact**: Improves performance for spatial queries.

```sql
SELECT * FROM locations WHERE ST_Within(geom, ST_MakeEnvelope(...));
```

#### 12. **BRIN Indexing**

- **Use Case**: Efficiently indexing large tables with ordered data.
- **Usage**: Create a BRIN index on columns with natural ordering.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_brin_timestamp ON large_table USING BRIN(timestamp);
```

- **Impact**: Saves space and can speed up queries on large datasets with ordered data.

```sql
SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE timestamp BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31';
```

#### 13. **Unique Indexes**

- **Use Case**: Enforcing data uniqueness while improving query performance.
- **Usage**: Create a unique index on columns that require unique values.

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_unique_username ON users(username);
```

- **Impact**: Ensures that no two users can have the same username and speeds up lookups for usernames.

#### 14. **Monitoring and Maintenance**

- **Use Case**: Ensuring indexes are being used efficiently.
- **Usage**: Regularly monitor index usage and bloat.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_user_indexes WHERE idx_scan = 0; -- Find unused indexes
```

- **Impact**: Identifies and allows for the removal of unused or ineffective indexes, reducing maintenance costs.

### Best Practices for Indexing

1. **Analyze Query Patterns**: Before creating indexes, analyze which queries are the most frequent and which columns are used in `WHERE`, `ORDER BY`, `JOIN`, and `GROUP BY` clauses.

2. **Avoid Over-Indexing**: While indexes improve read performance, they slow down write operations. Be selective in indexing.

3. **Use the Right Index Type**: Choose the appropriate index type based on the use case (e.g., use GIN for full-text search, GiST for geospatial data).

4. **Limit Multi-Column Indexes**: Only create multi-column indexes when the leading column is used in queries. The order of columns in the index matters.

5. **Regular Maintenance**: Periodically run `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE` to keep the database healthy and statistics updated.

6. **Testing and Monitoring**: Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to test query performance with and without indexes and to ensure that the indexes are being utilized as expected.

Each index type in PostgreSQL serves distinct purposes, and the choice of index should be guided by the specific query patterns and requirements of your application. By selecting the appropriate index type and using them effectively, you can significantly enhance query performance and maintain data integrity.

Indexing strategies in PostgreSQL (or any database) are critical when working with large datasets, like a table with terabytes of data. Indexes help speed up data retrieval, but the effectiveness of an index depends on the query patterns. Here's a breakdown of the questions you asked and some best practices:

### 1. **Indexing the ID Column**:

- **Primary key index (B-tree)**: When you index the `id` column (typically a primary key), it allows PostgreSQL to quickly retrieve rows by that ID. This type of index is **very effective when queries are filtering by the `id`** alone (e.g., `WHERE id = X`). Since this is a unique index, it is optimal for direct lookups.

- **Does it help when filtering on other columns**: If a query includes other criteria (e.g., `WHERE id = X AND col1 = Y`), the index on `id` is still used to narrow down the rows to those with `id = X`. However, filtering on `col1` will require additional work by PostgreSQL unless there’s an index on `col1` as well, making the index on `id` less useful in this case.

- **Becomes redundant**: Indexes on the `id` column don't become redundant, but their utility diminishes when additional columns are involved. The query planner may decide not to use the `id` index if other columns in the query lack indexes, which could lead to a full table scan.

### 2. **Combining Indexes with Multiple Columns**:

- **Composite Indexes (Multi-column indexes)**:
  For queries that filter on multiple columns, a composite index (indexing more than one column) can be very helpful. For instance, if your queries often filter on `id` and `col1`, a composite index on `(id, col1)` could significantly improve performance.

  However, **order matters** with composite indexes:

  - A composite index on `(id, col1)` can be used for queries like `WHERE id = X` or `WHERE id = X AND col1 = Y`.
  - But it **won’t be used efficiently** for queries that filter by `col1` alone (`WHERE col1 = Y`), unless `id` is always part of the filter.

  It’s important to ensure the leading column of a composite index is frequently used in queries for the index to be useful.

- **Covering Indexes**: If your queries are mostly **read-heavy** and you want to minimize access to the actual table (the disk), a covering index can be used. A covering index is a composite index that includes all the columns used in the query (including the ones in the `SELECT` clause).
  - For example, if your query is: `SELECT col1, col2 FROM table WHERE id = X AND col1 = Y`, an index on `(id, col1, col2)` can make the query run very efficiently since the index alone covers all the information required without needing to access the actual table.

### 3. **Partial Indexes**:

- **Partial indexes** are useful if queries often filter by specific conditions. Instead of indexing the entire table, you can create an index on a subset of data. For example:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_partial_col1 ON table (col1) WHERE col1 IS NOT NULL;
  ```
  This can reduce the index size and improve performance when you often filter with certain criteria.

### 4. **Types of Indexes**:

- **B-tree index**: The default index type, suitable for equality (`=`) and range (`<`, `>`) queries. Most commonly used.
- **GIN and GiST indexes**: These are more specialized and useful for full-text search, JSONB columns, and geometric data types. GIN indexes are especially helpful for text search or array fields.

### 5. **Indexing and Query Planning**:

- **Analyze query patterns**: Indexes should match your common query patterns. Use the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` command to see how PostgreSQL is planning to execute your queries. If the planner is not using an index as expected, consider creating a more appropriate index based on the query.

- **Index-only scans**: In cases where a query can be satisfied entirely by the index (i.e., the index contains all the columns needed), PostgreSQL can perform an "index-only scan," which is faster than accessing the table itself.

- **Unique Indexes**: If a column (or combination of columns) must contain unique values, creating a unique index helps enforce this constraint and optimizes lookup.

### 6. **General Best Practices for Large Tables**:

- **Avoid over-indexing**: Indexes consume disk space and can slow down `INSERT`/`UPDATE` operations, as each change must also update the relevant indexes. Only create indexes that improve performance for your most frequent and important queries.

- **Vacuuming and maintenance**: Regularly vacuum and analyze your large tables, as this helps PostgreSQL optimize query plans and maintain index performance.

- **Partitioning**: For very large tables (in the terabyte range), consider partitioning, especially if queries often filter based on a specific time range or category. Partitioning can reduce the amount of data PostgreSQL has to scan and thus speed up queries.

### 7. **Practical Example**:

Suppose you have a table `orders` with columns like `order_id`, `customer_id`, `status`, `order_date`, and `total`. You may have the following query patterns:

- `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_id = X`

---

Indexing in PostgreSQL can greatly improve the performance of queries, especially on large tables. However, the effectiveness of an index depends on how the index is used in queries, and how well it matches the columns involved in filters, joins, and sorts. Let's break down the key considerations and strategies:

### 1. **Indexing on the ID Column**

- **When is it useful?** Indexing on an `id` column (usually a primary key) is very effective when:
  - You frequently query rows by the `id` column.
  - The `id` is used in `WHERE` clauses for filtering.
  - The `id` is used in joins (e.g., foreign keys).
- **What are its limitations?**
  - An index on just the `id` column will only speed up queries that filter or sort based **solely** on the `id` column.
  - If your queries involve additional columns (e.g., `WHERE id = x AND status = 'active'`), the index on `id` alone may not be enough, and PostgreSQL will need to scan the table for other criteria.

### 2. **Multi-Column Indexes (Composite Indexes)**

- **When is it useful?** Composite (multi-column) indexes are helpful when:
  - Queries filter on **multiple columns**, not just the `id`.
  - The order of columns in the index matches the most common patterns of filtering (leftmost columns are used first).
- **Best practices:**
  - **Column order matters**: In a composite index, PostgreSQL will use the index as long as the query includes conditions on the **leftmost** columns of the index.
  - For example, if you create an index on `(id, status)`, it will be used by queries like `WHERE id = x AND status = 'active'`, but not as efficiently for `WHERE status = 'active'` alone.

### 3. **Covering Indexes**

- A **covering index** is when the index includes all the columns needed to satisfy a query without needing to read the actual table. For example, if a query retrieves data only from `id` and `status`, an index on `(id, status)` would cover the query and prevent the need to access the table itself, reducing disk I/O.
- This is especially beneficial for large tables where table scans are expensive.

### 4. **Partial Indexes**

- If certain queries are only relevant for a subset of rows (e.g., active users), you can create a **partial index** that only indexes rows matching specific conditions.
- For example, `CREATE INDEX idx_active_users ON users (id) WHERE status = 'active'`. This index would only apply to users who are active, reducing the size of the index and improving performance for queries that target active users.

### 5. **Index on Frequently Filtered Columns**

- Besides the `id` column, you should also index columns that are **frequently filtered** in queries (`WHERE` conditions). This could include status, date ranges, or categories.
- **B-Tree** indexes are good for equality and range queries (e.g., `status = 'active'`, `date BETWEEN x AND y`).

### 6. **Combining Indexes**

- **Single vs. Composite Indexes**: In many cases, having one composite index (e.g., `(id, status, date_created)`) can be more efficient than having multiple single-column indexes. PostgreSQL can combine multiple indexes using a technique called a **bitmap index scan**, but composite indexes are typically more efficient if the columns are frequently queried together.
- **Avoid too many indexes**: Indexes come with overhead. They consume disk space and slow down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations, since PostgreSQL needs to maintain the index. So, you should index only the columns that are frequently used in queries.

### 7. **Index Types**

- **B-Tree Index (Default)**: Great for most queries, especially equality and range queries (e.g., `WHERE id = 1`, `WHERE date BETWEEN x AND y`).
- **GIN/GIST Index**: Useful for full-text search, JSONB data types, and multi-dimensional data (like geospatial queries).
- **Hash Index**: Useful for exact match queries (`WHERE column = 'value'`), but less common since B-Tree can handle most cases.

### 8. **Query Plan Analysis (EXPLAIN)**

- Use `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to understand how PostgreSQL is executing a query and whether it is using indexes as expected.
- This will help you see if the indexes are being used effectively, if there are any sequential scans, and whether query performance can be improved by adding or modifying indexes.

### 9. **Best Indexing Strategy for a Large Table**

For a table with terabytes of data and multiple columns:

- **Primary Key Index**: Index the primary key (`id`) column if not already done.
- **Composite Indexes**: Create composite indexes for common query patterns (e.g., `WHERE id = ? AND status = ?` or `WHERE id = ? AND created_at BETWEEN ? AND ?`).
- **Partial Indexes**: If queries often target a subset of data (e.g., active users, specific date ranges), consider partial indexes.
- **Avoid Over-indexing**: Too many indexes can slow down write operations, so balance the number of indexes based on query patterns.
- **Regularly Analyze and Vacuum**: Ensure regular maintenance (e.g., `VACUUM`, `ANALYZE`) to keep statistics up to date and indexes optimized.

### Example Index Strategy

For a table `users(id, name, status, created_at, last_login)`:

1. Index on `id`: `CREATE INDEX idx_users_id ON users (id);`
2. Composite index on `id` and `status`: `CREATE INDEX idx_users_id_status ON users (id, status);`
3. Composite index for date filtering: `CREATE INDEX idx_users_id_date ON users (id, created_at);`
4. Partial index for active users: `CREATE INDEX idx_active_users ON users (id) WHERE status = 'active';`

This would cover typical queries like:

- `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123;`
- `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 123 AND status = 'active';`
- `SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-06-01';`

Each of these queries would benefit from the right indexes.

Optimizing indexes in PostgreSQL for performance tuning is a complex process that involves understanding the structure of the database, the workload (read-heavy, write-heavy, or mixed), and how queries are executed. Below are **advanced index tuning strategies and ideas** to maximize performance and efficiency for various workloads.

### 1. **Index Type Tuning**

Choosing the right index type is the foundation for tuning. Here are some specialized index types available in PostgreSQL:

- **B-Tree Index (Default)**: This is the most commonly used index type, ideal for equality (`=`), range queries (`BETWEEN`), and sorting (`ORDER BY`). This index type works well for most general-purpose cases.
- **GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)**: Great for indexing complex data types, such as arrays, JSONB, full-text search, and hstore. GIN indexes can handle "contains" operations (`@>`), which makes them useful for searching within arrays or JSON documents.
- **GiST (Generalized Search Tree)**: Useful for geometric and spatial data (PostGIS) or even full-text search. It can handle proximity searches, range queries, and searches on complex data types.
- **BRIN (Block Range INdex)**: Designed for large, read-heavy tables with sequentially ordered data (like time-series data). BRIN is very space-efficient and works well for queries over large ranges, where values are clustered together.
- **Hash Index**: Optimized for exact match queries (`=`). Less flexible than B-Tree but can be slightly faster for certain workloads involving unique constraints.

### 2. **Partial Indexes**

- **Optimize for common query patterns** by creating indexes that only apply to a subset of data. This not only reduces index size but also improves query performance for targeted queries.
- Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_active_users ON users (last_login) WHERE status = 'active';
  ```
  This index would speed up queries like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE status = 'active' AND last_login IS NOT NULL;`.

### 3. **Expression Indexes (Functional Indexes)**

- You can create indexes on computed expressions, allowing the database to index the result of a function or computation.
- Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_lower_username ON users (lower(username));
  ```
  This would improve performance for queries like `SELECT * FROM users WHERE lower(username) = 'john';`.

### 4. **Covering Indexes (INCLUDE Clause)**

- PostgreSQL supports **covering indexes**, where you include extra columns in the index for the purpose of avoiding accessing the table altogether (also known as index-only scans).
- The `INCLUDE` clause allows you to include columns in the index that are not part of the search but are returned in the query result.
- Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_users_id_status ON users (id, status) INCLUDE (email);
  ```
  This index will speed up queries that filter by `id` and `status` and return `email` without needing to read the entire row from the table.

### 5. **Multi-Column (Composite) Index Tuning**

- Create **composite indexes** for queries that frequently filter on multiple columns. When deciding on the order of the columns, remember that:
  - **The leftmost columns** in the index are most important. PostgreSQL can only use the index if a query filters or sorts based on these leftmost columns.
  - **Order by usage**: Place columns that are most frequently used for filtering first.
  - Example: For queries like `SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = ? AND status = ? AND order_date > ?`, you should create an index in the following order:
    ```sql
    CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_status_date ON orders (customer_id, status, order_date);
    ```
  - **Prefix optimization**: PostgreSQL can use a prefix of a composite index. For instance, the index `(customer_id, status, order_date)` will also be used by queries filtering only by `customer_id` or `customer_id` and `status`.

### 6. **Combining Bitmap Indexes**

- PostgreSQL can combine indexes using **bitmap index scans**. If you don’t create a composite index for a query, PostgreSQL might combine multiple single-column indexes into a bitmap index scan. However, composite indexes are generally more efficient, especially for common query patterns.
- Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer ON orders (customer_id);
  CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status ON orders (status);
  ```

### 7. **Unique Indexes**

- Use **unique indexes** to enforce uniqueness on columns and speed up queries involving equality constraints.
- Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_users_email ON users (email);
  ```

### 8. **Index on Foreign Key Columns**

- Indexing foreign key columns is critical for improving join performance. For example, if you have a `orders` table that references `customers`, index the foreign key.
- Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_id ON orders (customer_id);
  ```

### 9. **Reindexing**

- Over time, indexes can become bloated due to frequent inserts, updates, and deletes. Reindexing helps to rebuild them and optimize storage.
- Use:
  ```sql
  REINDEX INDEX idx_name;
  ```

### 10. **Avoid Over-Indexing**

- While indexes improve read performance, they also add overhead to writes (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`). Each index must be maintained when the underlying data changes, so **avoid creating too many indexes**, especially on frequently updated tables.
- Regularly **review and drop unused indexes** using PostgreSQL’s index usage statistics (`pg_stat_user_indexes`).

### 11. **Index Maintenance (VACUUM, ANALYZE)**

- Regularly run **`VACUUM`** and **`ANALYZE`** to keep statistics updated and remove dead tuples (row versions marked for deletion). This helps PostgreSQL’s query planner make better decisions.
- Example:
  ```sql
  VACUUM ANALYZE;
  ```

### 12. **Clustered Indexes**

- PostgreSQL doesn’t have clustered indexes in the same way as other databases (like SQL Server), but you can simulate clustering by **physically ordering data** according to an index using the `CLUSTER` command.
- Example:
  ```sql
  CLUSTER users USING idx_users_last_login;
  ```
  This arranges the physical table order according to `last_login`, which can significantly speed up range queries.

### 13. **Dealing with NULL Values**

- By default, B-Tree indexes don’t index `NULL` values. If your queries involve `NULL` conditions, you may want to create partial indexes or use a specific strategy to handle `NULL` values.
- Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_users_non_null_status ON users (status) WHERE status IS NOT NULL;
  ```

### 14. **Conditional Indexes for Specific Queries**

- For specific high-performance needs, you can create indexes that directly match query conditions.
- Example: If you frequently query for recently created orders:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_recent_orders ON orders (created_at) WHERE created_at > now() - interval '30 days';
  ```

### 15. **Adaptive Indexing (HypoPG)**

- PostgreSQL doesn’t support "adaptive" indexing out of the box, but you can use extensions like **HypoPG** to simulate indexes before actually creating them. This can help you test how a hypothetical index would affect performance before committing to it.

### 16. **Parallel Index Creation**

- On large tables, you can create indexes in parallel to speed up the process. Set `max_parallel_maintenance_workers` in your configuration or use `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` to avoid locking the table during index creation.
- Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_users_email ON users (email);
  ```

### 17. **PostgreSQL Auto-Tuning Extensions**

- Use extensions like **pg_stat_statements** to track and analyze query performance. This helps identify which queries are slow and which columns might benefit from new indexes.
- Example:
  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
  ```

### 18. **Monitoring Index Performance**

- Continuously monitor index performance using PostgreSQL's built-in tools (`pg_stat_user_indexes`, `pg_stat_user_tables`) to see which indexes are being used and which are being ignored.
- Query:
  ```sql
  SELECT
    relname AS table_name,
    indexrelname AS index_name,
    idx_scan AS number_of_scans,
    idx_tup_read AS tuples_read,
    idx_tup_fetch AS tuples_fetched
  FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
  ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;
  ```

By implementing these strategies, you can significantly improve the performance of large and complex databases in PostgreSQL. Regularly reviewing your index strategy based on query patterns and database workload is essential for ongoing optimization.
