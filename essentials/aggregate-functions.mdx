Aggregate functions in PostgreSQL are powerful tools for performing calculations on multiple rows of data to return a single value. They are widely used in SQL queries for reporting and data analysis. Below, I'll provide a comprehensive overview of the basics and advanced usages of aggregate functions in PostgreSQL, complete with full-fledged implementations and examples.

## Basics of Aggregate Functions

### Common Aggregate Functions

1. **COUNT()**: Counts the number of rows.
2. **SUM()**: Returns the sum of a numeric column.
3. **AVG()**: Returns the average value of a numeric column.
4. **MIN()**: Returns the minimum value in a set.
5. **MAX()**: Returns the maximum value in a set.

### Basic Example

Let’s assume we have a simple table named `sales`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    quantity INTEGER,
    price NUMERIC(10, 2),
    sale_date DATE
);
```

#### Insert Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO sales (product_name, quantity, price, sale_date) VALUES
('Apple', 10, 1.00, '2024-10-01'),
('Banana', 20, 0.50, '2024-10-01'),
('Orange', 15, 0.80, '2024-10-01'),
('Apple', 5, 1.00, '2024-10-02'),
('Banana', 30, 0.50, '2024-10-02');
```

### Basic Aggregate Queries

1. **Count the total number of sales records:**

   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales FROM sales;
   ```

2. **Calculate the total revenue from all sales:**

   ```sql
   SELECT SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue FROM sales;
   ```

3. **Calculate the average quantity sold:**

   ```sql
   SELECT AVG(quantity) AS average_quantity FROM sales;
   ```

4. **Find the minimum and maximum price:**

   ```sql
   SELECT MIN(price) AS min_price, MAX(price) AS max_price FROM sales;
   ```

## Grouping Data with Aggregate Functions

Using the `GROUP BY` clause, you can group rows that have the same values in specified columns into summary rows.

### Grouped Example

1. **Total quantity sold per product:**

   ```sql
   SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY product_name;
   ```

2. **Average price per product:**

   ```sql
   SELECT product_name, AVG(price) AS average_price
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY product_name;
   ```

3. **Count of sales by date:**

   ```sql
   SELECT sale_date, COUNT(*) AS sales_count
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY sale_date;
   ```

## Advanced Aggregate Functions

### 1. **HAVING Clause**

The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups based on aggregate values.

#### Example: Total quantity sold greater than 20

```sql
SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_name
HAVING SUM(quantity) > 20;
```

### 2. **Window Functions**

Window functions perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.

#### Example: Running total of sales

```sql
SELECT
    sale_date,
    product_name,
    quantity,
    SUM(quantity) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS running_total
FROM sales
ORDER BY sale_date;
```

### 3. **Using DISTINCT with Aggregate Functions**

You can use `DISTINCT` within aggregate functions to count unique values or sum unique entries.

#### Example: Count distinct products sold

```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_name) AS distinct_products_sold
FROM sales;
```

### 4. **Combine Multiple Aggregate Functions**

You can also combine multiple aggregate functions in a single query.

#### Example: Total quantity, average price, and max price per product

```sql
SELECT product_name,
       SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity,
       AVG(price) AS average_price,
       MAX(price) AS max_price
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_name;
```

### 5. **Using Aggregate Functions in Subqueries**

You can use aggregate functions in subqueries to perform more complex analyses.

#### Example: Find products that generated more than the average revenue

```sql
WITH total_revenue AS (
    SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY product_name
)
SELECT product_name
FROM total_revenue
WHERE revenue > (SELECT AVG(revenue) FROM total_revenue);
```

## Complete Implementation Example

### Step 1: Create Database and Table

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sales_db;

\c sales_db;

CREATE TABLE sales (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    quantity INTEGER,
    price NUMERIC(10, 2),
    sale_date DATE
);
```

### Step 2: Insert Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO sales (product_name, quantity, price, sale_date) VALUES
('Apple', 10, 1.00, '2024-10-01'),
('Banana', 20, 0.50, '2024-10-01'),
('Orange', 15, 0.80, '2024-10-01'),
('Apple', 5, 1.00, '2024-10-02'),
('Banana', 30, 0.50, '2024-10-02');
```

### Step 3: Run Aggregate Queries

```sql
-- Total sales
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_sales FROM sales;

-- Total revenue
SELECT SUM(quantity * price) AS total_revenue FROM sales;

-- Average quantity
SELECT AVG(quantity) AS average_quantity FROM sales;

-- Total quantity sold per product
SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_name;

-- Products with total quantity sold greater than 20
SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM sales
GROUP BY product_name
HAVING SUM(quantity) > 20;

-- Running total of sales
SELECT
    sale_date,
    product_name,
    quantity,
    SUM(quantity) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS running_total
FROM sales
ORDER BY sale_date;

-- Count distinct products sold
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT product_name) AS distinct_products_sold
FROM sales;

-- Products generating more than average revenue
WITH total_revenue AS (
    SELECT product_name, SUM(quantity * price) AS revenue
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY product_name
)
SELECT product_name
FROM total_revenue
WHERE revenue > (SELECT AVG(revenue) FROM total_revenue);
```

### 1. Sales Analytics

**Scenario**: A retail company wants to analyze sales performance over time to identify trends and performance by region and product category.

#### Table Structure

Assuming we have a `sales` table and an additional `products` table for better categorization.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_name VARCHAR(100),
    category VARCHAR(100),
    price NUMERIC(10, 2)
);

CREATE TABLE sales (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products(id),
    quantity INTEGER,
    sale_date DATE,
    region VARCHAR(100)
);
```

#### Insert Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_name, category, price) VALUES
('Apple', 'Fruits', 1.00),
('Banana', 'Fruits', 0.50),
('Orange', 'Fruits', 0.80),

Custom aggregate functions in PostgreSQL allow you to define your own aggregation logic beyond the built-in functions. This is useful when you need to perform specific calculations that aren't covered by the standard aggregate functions. Custom aggregates can be defined using SQL or PL/pgSQL.

In this section, I'll provide a comprehensive guide to implementing custom aggregates in PostgreSQL, including:

1. **Creating a simple custom aggregate**
2. **Using complex data types with custom aggregates**
3. **Creating custom aggregates using PL/pgSQL**

### 1. Creating a Simple Custom Aggregate

Let's say we want to create a custom aggregate function to compute the **median** of a set of values.

#### Step 1: Create a Supporting Function

First, we need a function that will compute the state transition for our aggregate.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION median_state_transition(
    state double precision[],
    value double precision
) RETURNS double precision[] AS $$
BEGIN
    state := array_append(state, value);
    RETURN state;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Step 2: Create the Final Function

Next, we create a function that will finalize the result.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION median_final(state double precision[]) RETURNS double precision AS $$
BEGIN
    IF array_length(state, 1) IS NULL THEN
        RETURN NULL;
    END IF;

    SELECT percentile_cont(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY unnest(state))
    INTO result
    FROM (SELECT unnest(state) AS val) sub;

    RETURN result;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Step 3: Create the Custom Aggregate

Finally, we create the custom aggregate itself.

```sql
CREATE AGGREGATE median(double precision) (
    SFUNC = median_state_transition,
    STYPE = double precision[],
    FINALFUNC = median_final,
    INITCOND = '{}'
);
```

#### Step 4: Using the Custom Aggregate

Now, you can use the `median` aggregate function in your queries.

```sql
SELECT median(price) AS median_price
FROM sales;
```

### 2. Custom Aggregate for Complex Data Types

You can also create custom aggregates for complex data types, such as user-defined types (UDTs).

#### Step 1: Create a Composite Type

Let's define a composite type to store customer statistics.

```sql
CREATE TYPE customer_stats AS (
    total_spent NUMERIC(10, 2),
    order_count INTEGER
);
```

#### Step 2: Create a Supporting Function

We need a function to combine two customer statistics.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION combine_stats(
    stat1 customer_stats,
    stat2 customer_stats
) RETURNS customer_stats AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN ROW(stat1.total_spent + stat2.total_spent, stat1.order_count + stat2.order_count);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Step 3: Create the State Transition Function

We create a state transition function to initialize and aggregate customer statistics.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION customer_stats_transition(
    state customer_stats,
    order_total NUMERIC(10, 2)
) RETURNS customer_stats AS $$
BEGIN
    IF state IS NULL THEN
        state := ROW(0, 0);
    END IF;

    RETURN ROW(state.total_spent + order_total, state.order_count + 1);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Step 4: Create the Final Function

Create a function to finalize the customer statistics.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION customer_stats_final(state customer_stats)
RETURNS customer_stats AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN state;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Step 5: Create the Custom Aggregate

Now, let's create the custom aggregate function for customer statistics.

```sql
CREATE AGGREGATE customer_stats_agg(Numeric) (
    SFUNC = customer_stats_transition,
    STYPE = customer_stats,
    FINALFUNC = customer_stats_final,
    INITCOND = '(0, 0)'
);
```

#### Step 6: Using the Custom Aggregate

You can now use the custom aggregate to calculate total spent and order count for customers.

```sql
SELECT customer_id,
       customer_stats_agg(total_amount) AS stats
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

### 3. Creating Custom Aggregates Using PL/pgSQL

In more complex scenarios, you might want to implement custom logic that cannot be expressed easily using SQL alone. Here’s how to create a custom aggregate that calculates the **mode** (most frequently occurring value) of a set of numbers.

#### Step 1: Create a Supporting Function

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION mode_state_transition(
    state jsonb,
    value INTEGER
) RETURNS jsonb AS $$
DECLARE
    modes jsonb;
BEGIN
    -- Initialize if state is null
    IF state IS NULL THEN
        modes := '{}'::jsonb;
    ELSE
        modes := state;
    END IF;

    -- Count occurrences
    modes := jsonb_set(modes, to_jsonb(value::text), COALESCE(modes->value::text, '0')::INTEGER + 1::jsonb);

    RETURN modes;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Step 2: Create the Final Function

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION mode_final(state jsonb) RETURNS INTEGER AS $$
DECLARE
    result INTEGER;
    max_count INTEGER := 0;
    current_count INTEGER;
BEGIN
    IF state IS NULL THEN
        RETURN NULL;
    END IF;

    -- Find the mode
    SELECT key::INTEGER
    INTO result
    FROM jsonb_each(state)
    ORDER BY value::INTEGER DESC
    LIMIT 1;

    RETURN result;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### Step 3: Create the Custom Aggregate

```sql
CREATE AGGREGATE mode(INTEGER) (
    SFUNC = mode_state_transition,
    STYPE = jsonb,
    FINALFUNC = mode_final,
    INITCOND = '{}'
);
```

#### Step 4: Using the Custom Aggregate

Now, you can use the `mode` aggregate function in your queries:

```sql
SELECT mode(quantity) AS mode_quantity
FROM sales;
```
