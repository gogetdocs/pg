Subqueries, also known as inner queries or nested queries, are powerful tools in SQL that allow you to perform complex queries by embedding one query within another. In PostgreSQL, subqueries can be used in various contexts, including the `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` statements.

### Basics of Subqueries

A subquery is a query within another SQL query. It can return a single value, a row, or a table. Here are some basic uses of subqueries:

#### 1. Simple Subquery in a `SELECT` Statement

This is used to retrieve data based on the results of another query.

**Example**: Find employees who earn more than the average salary.

```sql
SELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

#### 2. Subquery in `FROM` Clause

Subqueries can also be used in the `FROM` clause to create a derived table.

**Example**: List average salaries by department.

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
FROM (SELECT department_id, salary FROM employees) AS dept_salaries
GROUP BY department_id;
```

#### 3. Subquery in `WHERE` Clause

Subqueries can help filter results in the `WHERE` clause.

**Example**: Find all employees in the departments that have an average salary above 50000.

```sql
SELECT employee_id, employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
    HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000
);
```

### Advanced Usages of Subqueries

Subqueries can also be more complex, involving joins, correlated subqueries, and updates.

#### 4. Correlated Subquery

A correlated subquery is a subquery that references columns from the outer query. It executes once for each row processed by the outer query.

**Example**: Find employees who earn more than the average salary of their respective departments.

```sql
SELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e1.department_id = e2.department_id
);
```

#### 5. Using Subquery for `UPDATE`

You can use subqueries to update records based on another query.

**Example**: Increase the salary of employees in the 'Sales' department by 10% where the average salary is below 60000.

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.10
WHERE department_id = (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM departments
    WHERE department_name = 'Sales'
)
AND (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = (
    SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales'
)) < 60000;
```

#### 6. Subquery for `DELETE`

You can also use subqueries in delete statements.

**Example**: Delete employees who work in departments with an average salary below 40000.

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
    HAVING AVG(salary) < 40000
);
```

### Complete Implementation

Let's consider a complete PostgreSQL implementation that includes creating tables, inserting data, and performing various subquery operations.

#### Step 1: Create Tables

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
    department_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    department_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    employee_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    salary DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    department_id INT REFERENCES departments(department_id)
);
```

#### Step 2: Insert Data

```sql
INSERT INTO departments (department_name) VALUES
('Sales'),
('Engineering'),
('HR'),
('Marketing');

INSERT INTO employees (employee_name, salary, department_id) VALUES
('Alice', 70000, 1),
('Bob', 55000, 1),
('Charlie', 120000, 2),
('David', 90000, 2),
('Eve', 45000, 3),
('Frank', 80000, 4);
```

#### Step 3: Queries with Subqueries

1. **Find Employees Earning More Than Average Salary**

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

2. **Average Salary by Department**

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

3. **Find Departments with Employees Earning More than $80,000**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT department_id
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id IN (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary > 80000
);
```

4. **Update Salaries in Sales Department**

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.10
WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Sales');
```

5. **Delete Employees in Low Salary Departments**

```sql
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
    HAVING AVG(salary) < 50000
);
```

---

### 7. Subqueries with `JOIN` Operations

Subqueries can be used in conjunction with `JOIN` operations to refine results.

**Example**: Find employees along with their department names where the employee's salary is greater than the average salary of all employees.

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name, e.salary, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

### 8. Ranking Employees with Subqueries

You can use subqueries to rank employees based on their salaries.

**Example**: Get the top 3 highest-paid employees from each department.

```sql
SELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary, department_id
FROM employees e1
WHERE (
    SELECT COUNT(*)
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e2.department_id = e1.department_id AND e2.salary > e1.salary
) < 3;
```

### 9. Subquery to Aggregate Data

Use subqueries to create aggregated views and reports.

**Example**: Generate a report showing the total salary per department along with the count of employees.

```sql
SELECT d.department_name,
       (SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = d.department_id) AS total_salary,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees WHERE department_id = d.department_id) AS employee_count
FROM departments d;
```

### 10. Subqueries with `EXISTS`

Using the `EXISTS` operator can improve performance in certain cases by stopping execution as soon as it finds a match.

**Example**: List departments that have at least one employee with a salary greater than 70000.

```sql
SELECT department_name
FROM departments d
WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM employees e
    WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id AND e.salary > 70000
);
```

### 11. Using Subqueries in Conditional Expressions

Subqueries can be embedded in conditional expressions to determine output.

**Example**: Create a view that shows employee names and their salary status (above or below average).

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_salary_status AS
SELECT employee_name,
       CASE
           WHEN salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) THEN 'Above Average'
           ELSE 'Below Average'
       END AS salary_status
FROM employees;
```

### 12. Dynamic Filtering with Subqueries

Use subqueries to dynamically filter data based on user-defined criteria.

**Example**: Find all employees whose salaries are greater than the average salary of employees in the 'Engineering' department.

```sql
SELECT employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = (SELECT department_id FROM departments WHERE department_name = 'Engineering')
);
```

### 13. Multi-Level Subqueries

You can use nested subqueries to handle complex queries that require multiple layers of filtering.

**Example**: Find employees who earn more than the average salary of employees who earn less than the average salary of the entire company.

```sql
SELECT employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary)
    FROM employees
    WHERE salary < (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)
);
```

### 14. Subquery for Conditional Aggregation

Use subqueries to conditionally aggregate data.

**Example**: Calculate the total salary of employees in each department where the department has more than 2 employees.

```sql
SELECT department_id,
       (SELECT SUM(salary) FROM employees e WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id) AS total_salary
FROM departments d
WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees e WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id) > 2;
```

### 15. Subqueries for Data Validation

Subqueries can also be useful for data validation tasks.

**Example**: Ensure that no employee has a salary less than the minimum salary in their department.

```sql
SELECT employee_id, employee_name
FROM employees e
WHERE salary < (
    SELECT MIN(salary)
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = e.department_id
);
```

### 16. Subqueries for Maintenance Operations

Subqueries can be used in maintenance tasks, such as archiving old data.

**Example**: Find and archive employees who havenâ€™t had any salary increment for more than 5 years.

```sql
SELECT employee_id, employee_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id NOT IN (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM salary_changes
    WHERE change_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '5 years'
);
```

### 17. Subquery with Aggregate Functions in `HAVING` Clause

You can utilize subqueries in the `HAVING` clause to filter grouped data.

**Example**: List departments with an average salary greater than the overall average salary.

```sql
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id
HAVING AVG(salary) > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

### 18. Using Common Table Expressions (CTE) as Subqueries

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) can also serve a similar purpose as subqueries and can improve readability.

**Example**: Find departments with their average salaries using a CTE.

```sql
WITH avg_salaries AS (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
)
SELECT d.department_name, a.average_salary
FROM departments d
JOIN avg_salaries a ON d.department_id = a.department_id
WHERE a.average_salary > 60000;
```

---

### 19. Subqueries for Conditional Updates

You can use subqueries to perform conditional updates based on certain criteria.

**Example**: Increase the salary of employees in departments with an average salary below 50,000 by 10%.

```sql
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.10
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
    HAVING AVG(salary) < 50000
);
```

### 20. Using Subqueries with `GROUP BY`

Subqueries can also be helpful in grouping data in a more dynamic way.

**Example**: Get the number of employees in each department that has a salary higher than the average salary for that department.

```sql
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*)
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id IN (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e2.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e2.department_id)
)
GROUP BY department_id;
```

### 21. Subqueries for Data Comparison

Use subqueries to compare data across different conditions or groups.

**Example**: Identify employees whose salary is above the average salary in their own department and also above the overall company average.

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary, department_id
FROM employees e
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e.department_id)
AND salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

### 22. Use Subqueries to Filter by Multiple Conditions

Subqueries can be used in filtering based on multiple related conditions.

**Example**: List all employees who earn more than the average salary of employees in the same department but only if their department has more than 3 employees.

```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM employees e
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT department_id
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 3 AND AVG(salary) < (
        SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e.department_id
    )
);
```

### 23. Find Employees with Unique Conditions Using Subqueries

You can identify unique records based on certain conditions.

**Example**: Find all employees whose salaries are higher than those of employees in the same department who have a lower rank.

```sql
SELECT employee_name
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT MAX(salary)
    FROM employees e2
    WHERE e1.department_id = e2.department_id AND e2.rank < e1.rank
);
```

### 24. Subqueries for Summarizing Data

Subqueries can be very effective for summarizing data over multiple levels.

**Example**: Calculate total compensation (salary + bonuses) for employees in each department.

```sql
SELECT department_id,
       SUM(salary + COALESCE(bonus, 0)) AS total_compensation
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN bonuses ON employees.employee_id = bonuses.employee_id
GROUP BY department_id;
```

### 25. Subqueries for Aggregation with Joins

You can join aggregated results from subqueries with other tables for detailed reporting.

**Example**: List departments with their total salary and the number of employees.

```sql
SELECT d.department_name,
       dept_totals.total_salary,
       dept_totals.employee_count
FROM departments d
JOIN (
    SELECT department_id,
           SUM(salary) AS total_salary,
           COUNT(*) AS employee_count
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
) AS dept_totals ON d.department_id = dept_totals.department_id;
```

### 26. Subqueries for Complex Reporting

Use subqueries to create complex reports that involve multiple criteria.

**Example**: Generate a report showing departments and the number of employees with salaries above the department average.

```sql
SELECT d.department_name,
       COUNT(e.employee_id) AS above_average_count
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
WHERE e.salary > (SELECT AVG(salary)
                  FROM employees
                  WHERE department_id = d.department_id)
GROUP BY d.department_name;
```

### 27. Using Subqueries to Analyze Trends

You can analyze trends over time using subqueries.

**Example**: Find employees whose salaries have increased over the past two years.

Assuming you have a `salary_history` table that logs salary changes.

```sql
SELECT employee_id, employee_name
FROM employees
WHERE employee_id IN (
    SELECT employee_id
    FROM salary_history
    WHERE change_date > NOW() - INTERVAL '2 years'
    GROUP BY employee_id
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 AND MAX(salary) > MIN(salary)
);
```

### 28. Subqueries for Recursive Data Structures

If you have hierarchical data, you can use subqueries in conjunction with recursive CTEs.

**Example**: Given a `employees` table that contains a `manager_id` field, find all employees under a specific manager.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE subordinates AS (
    SELECT employee_id, employee_name, manager_id
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id = (SELECT employee_id FROM employees WHERE employee_name = 'John Doe')  -- Replace with actual manager name
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name, e.manager_id
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN subordinates s ON e.manager_id = s.employee_id
)
SELECT * FROM subordinates;
```

### 29. Validate Data Integrity Using Subqueries

Subqueries can help in data validation tasks.

**Example**: Find employees who have a salary greater than the average salary of all employees in their department but do not have any associated bonus records.

```sql
SELECT e.employee_id, e.employee_name
FROM employees e
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees WHERE department_id = e.department_id
)
AND e.employee_id NOT IN (
    SELECT employee_id FROM bonuses
);
```

### 30. Subqueries for Handling Duplicates

Identify and handle duplicate records using subqueries.

**Example**: List employees with duplicate names in the system.

```sql
SELECT employee_name
FROM employees
GROUP BY employee_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```

### 31. Subqueries for Generating Reports with Conditional Logic

You can use subqueries to include conditional logic in your reports.

**Example**: Create a report showing employees with a flag indicating if they are above average earners.

```sql
SELECT employee_name,
       salary,
       CASE
           WHEN salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) THEN 'Above Average'
           ELSE 'Below Average'
       END AS salary_flag
FROM employees;
```

### 32. Complex Hierarchical Queries with Subqueries

Analyze hierarchical structures effectively with subqueries.

**Example**: Find all employees in a department and their managers.

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name AS employee,
       m.employee_name AS manager
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN employees m ON e.manager_id = m.employee_id;
```
