In PostgreSQL, performance tuning involves optimizing various aspects of the database to improve the speed and efficiency of queries and resource usage. This includes query optimization, resource utilization, and monitoring using native PostgreSQL queries and tools. Let’s dive into scenarios covering basic and advanced usages of performance tuning, profiling, query optimization, and resource monitoring.

### 1. **Query Optimization Strategies**

#### 1.1. **EXPLAIN / EXPLAIN ANALYZE**

Understanding how PostgreSQL executes queries is crucial for optimizing them. The `EXPLAIN` command shows the query execution plan without running the query, while `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` runs the query and shows the execution time.

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 100;

-- To get actual execution time and statistics:
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 100;
```

The output will show the following:

- **Seq Scan**: Full table scan (inefficient for large tables).
- **Index Scan**: Uses an index (faster for selective queries).
- **Sort**: Indicates a sorting operation.
- **Join**: If there are multiple tables being joined.

#### 1.2. **Use of Indexes**

Indexes can speed up queries significantly, especially for large datasets. However, unnecessary or excessive indexes can slow down write operations.

- **Creating Indexes:**
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
  ```
- **Checking Index Usage in a Query:** Run `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to ensure that your query uses the index (`Index Scan`) rather than a `Seq Scan`.

#### 1.3. **Avoid SELECT \* in Queries**

Specifying only required columns avoids unnecessary data fetching and reduces I/O.

```sql
SELECT order_id, order_date FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 100;
```

#### 1.4. **Use LIMIT with Pagination**

For paginating through large datasets, using `LIMIT` along with indexed columns is efficient.

```sql
SELECT order_id, order_date
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = 100
ORDER BY order_id
LIMIT 50 OFFSET 0;
```

#### 1.5. **Use Proper JOINs**

Choose the correct join type (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) based on your requirement to avoid unnecessary data processing.

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, c.name
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;
```

- Use `EXPLAIN` to check if the query uses a **Hash Join** or **Nested Loop** and whether it is efficient for the dataset size.

#### 1.6. **VACUUM ANALYZE**

Over time, PostgreSQL tables can become fragmented, affecting performance. Use `VACUUM` to clean up dead rows, and `ANALYZE` to update statistics for the query planner.

```sql
VACUUM ANALYZE orders;
```

### 2. **Resource Utilization Monitoring**

#### 2.1. **Monitoring Active Queries**

To monitor currently running queries in PostgreSQL, use the `pg_stat_activity` view.

```sql
SELECT pid, state, query, query_start, wait_event_type, wait_event
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active';
```

- `query_start`: Timestamp when the query started.
- `wait_event_type` and `wait_event`: Shows whether the query is waiting on some event (like a lock or I/O).

#### 2.2. **Monitoring Lock Contention**

Locks can significantly impact performance, especially in high-concurrency environments. To monitor lock contention:

```sql
SELECT pid, locktype, relation::regclass, mode, granted
FROM pg_locks
JOIN pg_stat_activity ON pg_locks.pid = pg_stat_activity.pid
WHERE NOT granted;
```

#### 2.3. **Database Size and Table Size**

To check the size of the database and its tables:

```sql
-- Database size:
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('your_database'));

-- Table size:
SELECT relname AS "Table", pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(relid)) AS "Size"
FROM pg_catalog.pg_statio_user_tables
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(relid) DESC;
```

#### 2.4. **Tracking Resource Usage: `pg_stat_statements` Extension**

`pg_stat_statements` provides statistics on all SQL queries executed. First, enable the extension:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_stat_statements;
```

Then, query the view to analyze slow queries:

```sql
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time, rows
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

This shows the slowest queries, including execution time and number of rows returned.

### 3. **Profiling a Query**

#### 3.1. **Track Long Queries: `log_min_duration_statement`**

You can log all queries that take longer than a specified duration by setting `log_min_duration_statement` in the PostgreSQL configuration file (`postgresql.conf`):

```bash
log_min_duration_statement = 1000  # Logs queries taking longer than 1 second
```

#### 3.2. **EXPLAIN with Buffers and Timing**

To profile a query's buffer and memory usage, use the `BUFFERS` and `TIMING` options in `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`:

```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 100;
```

- **Buffers**: Shows how many blocks were read from the disk vs. cache (shared/local buffers).
- **Timing**: Detailed timing information for each step in the query execution.

#### 3.3. **pg_stat_io for I/O Performance Analysis**

The `pg_stat_io` system view tracks input/output operations at a more granular level.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_io WHERE relname = 'orders';
```

### 4. **Advanced Optimization Techniques**

#### 4.1. **Partitioning**

Partitioning helps in breaking down large tables into smaller chunks to improve query performance, especially for time-series data.

- **Range Partitioning** example (by `order_date`):

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE orders_partitioned (
      order_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
      customer_id INT,
      order_date DATE
  ) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);

  CREATE TABLE orders_2022 PARTITION OF orders_partitioned
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2022-01-01') TO ('2022-12-31');

  CREATE TABLE orders_2023 PARTITION OF orders_partitioned
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-01-01') TO ('2023-12-31');
  ```

#### 4.2. **Parallel Query Execution**

PostgreSQL supports parallel query execution to distribute query load across multiple CPU cores.

- Enable parallel query execution in PostgreSQL configuration (`postgresql.conf`):
  ```bash
  max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4  # Adjust based on system resources
  ```
- Check if a query uses parallelism:
  ```sql
  EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE condition = true;
  ```
  Look for `Parallel Seq Scan` or `Parallel Index Scan` in the output.

#### 4.3. **Optimizer Hints with `pg_hint_plan`**

PostgreSQL does not natively support query hints, but you can use the `pg_hint_plan` extension to influence the query planner’s decisions.

- **Installing and Using `pg_hint_plan`:** First, install the extension:
  ```bash
  CREATE EXTENSION pg_hint_plan;
  ```
  Then, apply hints to influence query execution:
  ```sql
  SELECT /*+ SeqScan(orders) */ * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = 100;
  ```

This forces a sequential scan on the `orders` table, even if an index exists.

#### 4.4. **Materialized Views**

Materialized views store query results and can significantly improve performance for expensive queries.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW order_summary AS
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS total_orders
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- To refresh the materialized view periodically:
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW order_summary;
```

### 5. **Monitoring and Alerting with System Views**

#### 5.1. **pg_stat_user_tables**

To monitor activity like sequential scans and index scans on user tables:

```sql
SELECT relname, seq_scan, seq_tup_read, idx_scan, idx_tup_fetch
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
ORDER BY seq_scan DESC;
```

#### 5.2. **pg_stat_bgwriter**

Monitor background writer activity, which handles writing dirty buffers to disk:

```sql
SELECT checkpoints_timed, checkpoints_req, buffers_checkpoint, buffers_clean, buffers_backend
FROM pg_stat_bgwriter;
```

#### 5.3. **pg_stat_database**

This system view shows I/O stats, such as the number of blocks read and written:

```sql
SELECT datname, numbackends, xact_commit, xact_rollback, blks_read, blks_hit
FROM pg_stat_database;
```

---

### 6. **Advanced Query Optimization Techniques**

#### 6.1. **Index Types and Use Cases**

While basic B-tree indexes are used commonly, PostgreSQL supports other types of indexes that can optimize specific queries.

- **GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)**: Used for full-text search, array columns, and `jsonb` fields.
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_posts_content ON posts USING GIN(to_tsvector('english', content));
  ```
- **GiST (Generalized Search Tree)**: Useful for geometric data, full-text search, or range queries.
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_geom ON geospatial_data USING GIST(geom);
  ```
- **BRIN (Block Range INdex)**: For large tables where data is naturally ordered, like time-series data.
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_orders_date ON orders USING BRIN(order_date);
  ```
- **Partial Indexes**: Index only a subset of the data to save space and speed up queries on specific conditions.
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_orders_open ON orders(order_id) WHERE status = 'open';
  ```
- **Expression Indexes**: Index expressions rather than columns. Useful when queries often involve computed values.
  ```sql
  CREATE INDEX idx_orders_year ON orders((EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date)));
  ```

#### 6.2. **Caching and Data Locality Optimization**

- **Temporary Tables for Expensive Queries**: If a complex subquery is repeatedly used, consider storing the results in a temporary table.
  ```sql
  CREATE TEMP TABLE temp_customer_orders AS
  SELECT customer_id, COUNT(*) AS order_count FROM orders GROUP BY customer_id;
  ```
- **Reducing Cache Misses with HOT Updates**: PostgreSQL implements **Heap-Only Tuples (HOT)**, reducing index maintenance for updates if only non-indexed columns are updated. Ensure you're aware of which columns need indexing to reduce write overhead.

#### 6.3. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Subquery Optimization**

- **WITH Clause Optimizations**: Avoid using **WITH (CTE)** if the result of the query is large and will not be reused. PostgreSQL materializes CTEs by default, which can hurt performance in some cases.
  Starting from PostgreSQL 12, CTEs are inlined (optimized) by default, but it’s essential to monitor for specific cases where materialization is needed.
  ```sql
  WITH cte AS (
      SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2023-01-01'
  )
  SELECT * FROM cte WHERE customer_id = 100;
  ```
- **Lateral Joins**: Use `LATERAL` to compute a subquery for each row of the outer query. This is powerful when dealing with queries that depend on the result of an outer row.
  ```sql
  SELECT c.name, o.total
  FROM customers c
  CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
      SELECT SUM(amount) AS total
      FROM orders o
      WHERE o.customer_id = c.id
  ) o;
  ```

#### 6.4. **Window Functions Optimization**

Window functions can perform calculations across rows related to the current row. For large datasets, properly indexing partitioned data can make window functions faster.

```sql
SELECT customer_id, order_id, order_date,
       SUM(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id ORDER BY order_date) AS running_total
FROM orders;
```

- **Index on Partitioned Columns**: If window functions frequently use `PARTITION BY`, ensure there’s an index on those columns.

### 7. **Connection and Transaction Tuning**

#### 7.1. **Connection Pooling**

Each connection in PostgreSQL is heavyweight. Using a connection pooler like **PgBouncer** can help manage many concurrent connections efficiently by keeping idle connections alive.

- **PgBouncer** acts as a lightweight connection pooler, reducing the overhead of creating and tearing down connections. Ensure PostgreSQL is configured properly with pooled connections.
  ```bash
  max_connections = 100  # Reduce this if using PgBouncer
  ```

#### 7.2. **Idle In Transaction Timeouts**

Long-running idle transactions can hold locks and lead to contention. Use `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` to automatically terminate idle transactions after a certain time.

```bash
idle_in_transaction_session_timeout = '60s';
```

#### 7.3. **Transaction Isolation Levels**

Using stricter isolation levels like **SERIALIZABLE** can add overhead due to increased locking. For most use cases, the default **READ COMMITTED** or **REPEATABLE READ** isolation levels are sufficient and more performant.

```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
```

#### 7.4. **Batch Inserts and Updates**

Instead of running multiple `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statements, group them into larger batches to reduce transaction overhead.

```sql
INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, order_date, amount)
VALUES
  (1, '2024-01-01', 100),
  (2, '2024-01-02', 150),
  (3, '2024-01-03', 200);
```

Batching reduces disk I/O and CPU load by grouping multiple rows in a single operation.

### 8. **Memory Tuning and Performance Settings**

#### 8.1. **Memory and Workload Tuning**

- **Work Mem**: This setting controls how much memory PostgreSQL uses for sorts and hash operations. Increasing it can avoid disk-based operations for large queries.
  ```bash
  work_mem = '64MB';  # Set based on workload and available memory
  ```
- **Maintenance Work Mem**: Affects how much memory is used for maintenance operations like `VACUUM` and `CREATE INDEX`.
  ```bash
  maintenance_work_mem = '256MB';
  ```

#### 8.2. **Shared Buffers**

This is one of the most important settings for PostgreSQL. It controls the amount of memory used by PostgreSQL for caching data blocks.

- General rule: Set `shared_buffers` to 25-40% of available system memory.

```bash
shared_buffers = '4GB';
```

#### 8.3. **Effective Cache Size**

This setting tells PostgreSQL how much of the OS's file system cache is available for caching data.

- Typically, set `effective_cache_size` to around 75% of system memory to give the query planner a better idea of how much memory it can expect to be available.

```bash
effective_cache_size = '12GB';
```

#### 8.4. **Parallel Query Tuning**

Parallel queries can significantly speed up data processing for large datasets if tuned correctly.

- **max_parallel_workers_per_gather**: Controls the number of workers that can be used to execute parallel queries. Increase based on system cores and workload.
  ```bash
  max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;
  ```
- **parallel_setup_cost** and **parallel_tuple_cost**: These parameters help in controlling the threshold for when a query should be parallelized. Lowering these values makes PostgreSQL more likely to use parallel execution.

### 9. **Monitoring Tools and Strategies**

#### 9.1. **pg_stat_kcache Extension**

The `pg_stat_kcache` extension provides information about CPU usage per query. It collects statistics on CPU cycles, instructions, and cache misses.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_kcache;
```

You can then query the `pg_stat_kcache` view to analyze the CPU cost of queries:

```sql
SELECT pid, query, cpu_user_time, cpu_system_time
FROM pg_stat_kcache
JOIN pg_stat_activity USING (pid);
```

#### 9.2. **pg_stat_statements for Normalized Query Performance**

`pg_stat_statements` gives you insight into normalized query performance, including the number of calls, total execution time, and average time for each query. This can help identify frequently run slow queries.

```sql
SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time, stddev_time
FROM pg_stat_statements
ORDER BY total_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

- **Normalization**: This avoids the duplication of query data and gives performance stats at the template level.

#### 9.3. **Monitoring Query Planning: `pg_stat_plans`**

The `pg_stat_plans` extension provides detailed information about query planning.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_plans;
```

Once enabled, query the `pg_stat_plans` view:

```sql
SELECT query, execution_count, avg_total_time, min_total_time, max_total_time
FROM pg_stat_plans
ORDER BY avg_total_time DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### 9.4. **pg_repack for Table Bloat**

Over time, PostgreSQL tables can accumulate “bloat” (unused space) due to updates and deletes. The `pg_repack` extension allows you to reclaim space without locking the table.

- **Installing `pg_repack`**:
  ```bash
  CREATE EXTENSION pg_repack;
  ```
- **Repacking a table**:
  ```bash
  SELECT pg_repack.repack_table('public.orders');
  ```

#### 9.5. **pgBadger for Log Analysis**

Use **pgBadger**, a tool that parses PostgreSQL log files to generate detailed reports on query performance, index usage, connection activity, etc.

- **Steps**:
  - Configure

---

### 10. **Advanced Indexing Strategies**

#### 10.1. **Covering Indexes**

A covering index includes all the columns needed by a query, allowing PostgreSQL to retrieve data directly from the index without accessing the table. This can speed up read operations.

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_customer_date ON orders(customer_id, order_date);
```

- If you frequently run queries on `customer_id` and need the `order_date`, this index would be very effective.

#### 10.2. **Concurrent Index Creation**

Create indexes without locking out writes to the table using the `CONCURRENTLY` option. This is crucial for large tables in production.

```sql
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_orders_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
```

- Be cautious as this operation may take longer, and it's recommended to perform it during low-traffic periods.

#### 10.3. **Index Maintenance**

Regularly check for unused indexes that can slow down `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE idx_scan = 0;
```

- Consider dropping or consolidating indexes that are not used.

### 11. **Advanced Resource Monitoring Techniques**

#### 11.1. **pg_top for Real-time Monitoring**

Use **pg_top** to monitor PostgreSQL processes and resource usage in real-time. It provides insights into CPU usage, memory, and active queries.

```bash
pg_top -U your_user -d 1
```

- This command updates every second, providing a live view of the database's health.

#### 11.2. **pg_stat_activity for Blocking Queries**

Monitor blocked queries and identify potential deadlocks using `pg_stat_activity`.

```sql
SELECT blocked_locks.pid AS blocked_pid,
       blocked_activity.query AS blocked_query,
       blocking_locks.pid AS blocking_pid,
       blocking_activity.query AS blocking_query
FROM pg_catalog.pg_locks blocked_locks
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocked_activity ON blocked_activity.pid = blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_locks blocking_locks
    ON blocking_locks.locktype = blocked_locks.locktype
    AND blocking_locks.database IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.database
    AND blocking_locks.relation IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.relation
    AND blocking_locks.page IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.page
    AND blocking_locks.tuple IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.tuple
    AND blocking_locks.virtualxid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.virtualxid
    AND blocking_locks.transactionid IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.transactionid
    AND blocking_locks.virtualtransaction IS NOT DISTINCT FROM blocked_locks.virtualtransaction
    AND blocking_locks.pid != blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity blocking_activity ON blocking_activity.pid = blocking_locks.pid
WHERE NOT blocked_locks.granted;
```

#### 11.3. **pg_stat_progress_vacuum for VACUUM Monitoring**

Monitor the progress of `VACUUM` operations using `pg_stat_progress_vacuum`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_progress_vacuum;
```

- This provides insights into which tables are being vacuumed, how long the operation has been running, and how many tuples have been processed.

### 12. **Advanced Query Techniques**

#### 12.1. **JSONB Data Type Optimization**

If using JSONB, leverage indexing to speed up searches within JSON documents.

- **GIN Index for JSONB**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_jsonb_data ON your_table USING GIN (jsonb_column);
```

- **Querying JSONB**:

```sql
SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE jsonb_column @> '{"key": "value"}';
```

#### 12.2. **Array Manipulations**

PostgreSQL has powerful array capabilities that can optimize certain use cases. Use the `ANY` operator and array functions for efficient querying.

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE product_id = ANY(ARRAY[1, 2, 3]);
```

#### 12.3. **Table Functions and Set Returning Functions**

Use table functions and set-returning functions (SRFs) for complex operations that require multi-row returns, which can improve the readability and maintainability of your queries.

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_customer_orders(customer_id INT)
RETURNS TABLE(order_id INT, order_date DATE) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date FROM orders o WHERE o.customer_id = customer_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### 13. **Connection and Transaction Management Techniques**

#### 13.1. **Logical Replication for Load Balancing**

Use logical replication to distribute read queries across multiple replicas, improving read performance and allowing for better resource utilization.

- Configure logical replication by setting up subscriptions and publications.

#### 13.2. **Adjusting the `commit_delay`**

The `commit_delay` setting allows for a slight delay in commit operations to allow for better performance in high-throughput environments. This can reduce write amplification.

```bash
commit_delay = '100ms';  # Adjust based on system needs
```

### 14. **Server and Configuration Optimization**

#### 14.1. **Filesystem and Disk I/O Tuning**

Choose a filesystem optimized for database workloads, like **XFS** or **ext4**, and consider using SSDs for faster I/O.

#### 14.2. **Disk Write Optimization with `synchronous_commit`**

Change the `synchronous_commit` setting for specific use cases where you can afford to lose a few transactions for better write performance.

```bash
synchronous_commit = 'off';  # Not recommended for critical data
```

### 15. **Data Distribution and Partitioning**

#### 15.1. **Declarative Partitioning**

Leverage PostgreSQL’s declarative partitioning feature to improve query performance and data management.

```sql
CREATE TABLE measurement (
    city_id INT,
    logdate DATE,
    peaktemp INT,
    unitsales INT
) PARTITION BY RANGE (logdate);
```

- Create partitions for each month/year to enhance query performance.

#### 15.2. **Foreign Data Wrappers**

Utilize Foreign Data Wrappers (FDWs) to access external databases or sources directly from PostgreSQL, which can help distribute workload across systems.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION postgres_fdw;

CREATE SERVER foreign_server
    FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw
    OPTIONS (host 'foreignhost', dbname 'foreign_db', port '5432');

CREATE USER MAPPING FOR local_user
    SERVER foreign_server
    OPTIONS (user 'foreign_user', password 'foreign_pass');

CREATE FOREIGN TABLE foreign_orders (
    order_id INT,
    customer_id INT,
    order_date DATE
) SERVER foreign_server
OPTIONS (table_name 'orders');
```

### 16. **High Availability and Disaster Recovery**

#### 16.1. **Streaming Replication**

Set up streaming replication to maintain a real-time backup of your primary database, which can serve read queries and act as a failover.

- Use `wal_level` set to `replica` and configure the primary and standby servers correctly.

#### 16.2. **Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)**

Implement PITR to recover the database to a specific point in time, using WAL files.

- Ensure `archive_mode` is set to `on` and configure an archive command.

### 17. **Using Extensions for Enhanced Functionality**

#### 17.1. **TimescaleDB for Time-Series Data**

Use TimescaleDB, an extension built on PostgreSQL, to optimize time-series data management, offering features like automatic partitioning and time-series aggregation.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION timescaledb;

CREATE TABLE conditions (
    time        TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE NOT NULL,
    location    TEXT NOT NULL,
    temperature DOUBLE PRECISION NULL,
    humidity    DOUBLE PRECISION NULL
);

SELECT create_hypertable('conditions', 'time');
```

#### 17.2. **pg_partman for Partition Management**

Use `pg_partman` to automate the creation and maintenance of partitioned tables.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_partman;

SELECT partman.create_parent('public.orders', 'order_date', 'partman', 'monthly');
```

### 18. **Enhanced Logging and Auditing**

#### 18.1. **Detailed Query Logging**

Configure detailed logging for performance tuning and auditing purposes.

```bash
log_statement = 'all';  # Logs all queries; can be changed to 'ddl', 'mod', etc.
log_duration = 500;  # Log queries that take longer than 500ms
```

#### 18.2. **Audit Triggers**

Implement triggers to automatically log changes made to tables for auditing purposes.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders_audit (
    order_id INT,
    action VARCHAR(10),
    changed_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_order_change()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO orders_audit(order_id, action)
    VALUES (NEW.order_id, TG_OP);
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER order_change_trigger
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON orders
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION log_order_change();
```

### 19. **Regular Maintenance and Health Checks**

#### 19.1. **Routine VACUUM and ANALYZE**

Regularly schedule `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE` tasks to maintain database health, especially in systems with frequent updates and deletes.

```sql
VACUUM (VERBOSE, ANALYZE);
```

#### 19.2. **Monitoring Disk Usage**

Regularly monitor disk usage and database size to avoid running out of space.

```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('your_database'));
```

---

### 20. **Advanced Query Optimization Techniques**

#### 20.1. **Plan Caching and Reusing Plans**

PostgreSQL caches execution plans for prepared statements, which can speed up repeated query executions. You can use prepared statements or PL/pgSQL functions to take advantage of this feature.

```sql
PREPARE my_query AS
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE customer_id = $1;

EXECUTE my_query(123);
```

#### 20.2. **Use of Query Hints**

While PostgreSQL doesn’t support query hints directly like Oracle, you can control the query planner's behavior through configuration settings and by rewriting queries.

- **Configuration Settings**: Adjust settings such as `join_collapse_limit`, `from_collapse_limit`, and `enable_seqscan` to influence planner decisions.

```bash
SET join_collapse_limit = 1;  -- Forces planner to consider joins in a specific order
SET enable_seqscan = off;      -- Forces index scans instead of sequential scans
```

#### 20.3. **Handling Function Call Overhead**

Functions can introduce overhead, especially if they are called many times within a query. To mitigate this, consider:

- **Inlining Functions**: Use simple expressions instead of calling a function when possible.
- **SQL Functions vs. PL/pgSQL Functions**: Use SQL functions for performance-critical operations since they can be optimized better by the planner.

### 21. **Advanced Indexing Techniques**

#### 21.1. **Bloom Indexes**

For high-cardinality columns where you often perform searches, use Bloom indexes which can improve performance for certain types of queries.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION bloom;

CREATE INDEX idx_bloom_orders ON orders USING bloom (customer_id);
```

#### 21.2. **Custom Index Types**

Leverage custom index types like **PostGIS** for geospatial queries, which can significantly enhance performance in specific applications.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;

CREATE TABLE locations (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    geom GEOMETRY(Point, 4326)
);

CREATE INDEX ON locations USING GIST (geom);
```

### 22. **Partitioning Strategies**

#### 22.1. **Subpartitioning**

Consider subpartitioning large partitions for more granular control. This is particularly useful for large datasets that require frequent access.

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    sale_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    sale_date DATE NOT NULL,
    region TEXT NOT NULL
) PARTITION BY RANGE (sale_date) PARTITION BY LIST (region);
```

#### 22.2. **Partition Maintenance**

Regularly check for empty partitions and drop them to maintain query performance and reduce maintenance overhead.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sales_2022_jan;
```

### 23. **Configuration and Resource Management**

#### 23.1. **Effective I/O Configuration**

Tune I/O settings to optimize disk access patterns, particularly in high-transaction environments:

- **`random_page_cost`**: Adjust to reflect the performance of your underlying storage. Lower values encourage the use of indexes.

```bash
random_page_cost = 1.1;  # If using SSDs
```

- **Denormalization**: In read-heavy applications, consider denormalizing certain parts of your schema to reduce the number of joins needed during queries.

#### 31.2. **Using Composite Types**

Leverage composite types for complex data structures to simplify query syntax and reduce the number of joins.

```sql
CREATE TYPE address AS (
    street TEXT,
    city TEXT,
    state TEXT,
    zip TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    address address
);
```

### 32. **Query Refactoring**

#### 32.1. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**

Use CTEs to simplify complex queries, but be aware that CTEs can sometimes lead to suboptimal plans if not optimized correctly.

```sql
WITH recent_orders AS (
    SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days'
)
SELECT customer_id, SUM(total)
FROM recent_orders
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

#### 32.2. **Avoiding Functions on Indexed Columns**

Ensure that indexed columns are not wrapped in functions in your queries, as this can prevent the use of the index.

```sql
-- Avoid this
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE DATE(order_date) = '2024-01-01';

-- Instead, use this
SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_date < '2024-01-02';
```

### 33. **PostgreSQL Configuration Tweaks**

#### 33.1. **Effective Cache Size**

COPY orders (order_id, customer_id, order_date) FROM '/path/to/orders.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

#### 39.2. **Batch Updates with CASE**

For large batch updates, use a single `UPDATE` statement with a `CASE` expression instead of multiple statements.

```sql
UPDATE orders
SET status = CASE
    WHEN order_date < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '30 days' THEN 'archived'
    WHEN order_date < CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days' THEN 'processed'
    ELSE 'pending'
END;
```

### 40. **Database Maintenance Automation**

#### 40.1. **Automating VACUUM and ANALYZE**
