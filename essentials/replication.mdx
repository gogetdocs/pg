logical replication vs physical and streaming in posgres difference

---

In PostgreSQL, replication is a method of copying and maintaining database objects, such as tables, in multiple databases. There are several replication methods, with **logical replication**, **physical replication**, and **streaming replication** being the most common. Here's a breakdown of the differences between these types of replication:

### 1. Logical Replication

- **Definition**: Logical replication allows for the replication of data at the level of database objects, such as tables or rows, rather than at the level of the database files.
- **How It Works**: Changes made to a source database are captured and then applied to a target database. This is done using the **Publish/Subscribe** model.
  - **Publication**: The source database publishes specific tables to be replicated.
  - **Subscription**: The target database subscribes to those published tables to receive updates.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Selective replication of specific tables or rows.
  - Migrating data between different versions of PostgreSQL.
  - Replicating data between heterogeneous systems.
- **Advantages**:
  - Flexibility in selecting what to replicate.
  - Supports replication between different versions of PostgreSQL.
  - Enables data filtering and transformation before replication.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - More complex to set up and manage compared to physical replication.
  - Potentially higher overhead due to data transformation.

### 2. Physical Replication

- **Definition**: Physical replication involves the copying of the entire database cluster at the file level. It replicates the actual data files and their binary representation.
- **How It Works**: Changes in the database are recorded in the Write Ahead Log (WAL), which is then sent to the replica database to apply the changes.
- **Use Cases**:
  - High availability setups.
  - Disaster recovery solutions.
  - Creating standby servers for load balancing.
- **Advantages**:
  - Simple to set up; just requires configuration of the primary and replica servers.
  - Provides a real-time, exact copy of the source database.
  - Works well for read-heavy applications.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - No flexibility in choosing specific tables to replicate.
  - Requires the same version of PostgreSQL on both primary and replica.
  - Can lead to issues with disk space since it replicates the entire database.

### 3. Streaming Replication

- **Definition**: Streaming replication is a specific type of physical replication where the WAL records are sent continuously to the standby server as they are created.
- **How It Works**: The primary server sends WAL data to the standby server in real-time, allowing for near real-time replication of data.
- **Use Cases**:
  - High-availability environments.
  - Environments where minimal lag is required between primary and standby databases.
- **Advantages**:
  - Provides real-time data availability on standby servers.
  - Allows for read scaling by offloading read queries to standby servers.
- **Disadvantages**:
  - Requires network stability and bandwidth for optimal performance.
  - Like physical replication, it does not allow selective table replication.

### 1. Logical Replication

Logical replication in PostgreSQL involves setting up a **publisher** and a **subscriber**.

#### **Step 1: Enable Logical Replication**

1. **Edit `postgresql.conf`**:

   - Find the `postgresql.conf` file, typically located in the data directory of your PostgreSQL installation.
   - Enable logical replication:
     ```plaintext
     wal_level = logical
     max_replication_slots = 4
     max_wal_senders = 4
     ```

2. **Edit `pg_hba.conf`**:

   - Add the following line to allow replication connections from the subscriber:
     ```plaintext
     host    replication     all             <subscriber_ip>/32         md5
     ```

3. **Restart PostgreSQL**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart postgresql
   ```

#### **Step 2: Set Up the Publisher**

1. **Connect to the Publisher** (using `psql`):

   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -d your_database
   ```

2. **Create a Publication**:

   ```sql
   CREATE PUBLICATION my_publication FOR TABLE your_table;
   ```

#### **Step 3: Set Up the Subscriber**

1. **Connect to the Subscriber**:

   ```bash
   psql -U postgres -d your_subscriber_database
   ```

2. **Create a Subscription**:

   ```sql
   CREATE SUBSCRIPTION my_subscription CONNECTION 'host=<publisher_ip> dbname=your_database user=postgres password=your_password' PUBLICATION my_publication;
   ```

#### **Step 4: Verify the Setup**

- Check the subscription status:
  ```sql
  \dx
  ```
- View replication status:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM pg_stat_subscription;
  ```

### 2. Physical Replication (Streaming Replication)

Physical replication involves setting up a primary and standby server.

#### **Step 1: Configure the Primary Server**

1. **Edit `postgresql.conf`**:

   ```plaintext
   wal_level = replica
   max_wal_senders = 3
   wal_keep_segments = 64
   ```

2. **Edit `pg_hba.conf`**:

   - Allow replication connections:

   ```plaintext
   host    replication     all             <standby_ip>/32         md5
   ```

3. **Restart PostgreSQL**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart postgresql
   ```

4. **Create a Replication User**:

   ```sql
   CREATE ROLE replicator WITH REPLICATION LOGIN PASSWORD 'your_password';
   ```

#### **Step 2: Set Up the Standby Server**

1. **Base Backup**:

   - Use `pg_basebackup` to create a base backup from the primary server:

   ```bash
   pg_basebackup -h <primary_ip> -D /var/lib/postgresql/data -U replicator -P --wal-method=stream
   ```

2. **Create `recovery.conf`**:

   - Create a file named `recovery.conf` in the standby data directory with the following content:

   ```plaintext
   standby_mode = 'on'
   primary_conninfo = 'host=<primary_ip> port=5432 user=replicator password=your_password'
   trigger_file = '/tmp/postgresql.trigger.5432'
   ```

3. **Start the Standby Server**:

   - Start PostgreSQL on the standby server:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start postgresql
   ```

#### **Step 3: Verify the Setup**

- Check the replication status on the primary:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;
  ```
- On the standby server, check:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM pg_stat_wal_receiver;
  ```

### 3. Streaming Replication (as a subset of Physical Replication)

Streaming replication is the same as physical replication but focuses on the continuous WAL data stream.

- The setup for streaming replication is essentially the same as physical replication. By ensuring that WAL is streamed continuously from the primary server, you achieve streaming replication.

#### **Monitoring Streaming Replication**

You can monitor the replication lag and other metrics:

- On the Primary:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_replication;
```

- On the Standby:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_wal_receiver;
```

### Additional Considerations

- **Network Configuration**: Ensure that firewall settings allow traffic on the PostgreSQL port (default is 5432).
- **Testing Failover**: It's important to regularly test failover processes to ensure high availability.
- **Monitoring Tools**: Consider using monitoring tools like `pgAdmin`, `Prometheus`, or `Grafana` for better visualization of replication status.
- **Backup Strategy**: Regularly back up your databases, especially before making changes to replication configurations.
- **Replication Lag**: Monitor for replication lag to ensure the standby is up-to-date with the primary.
