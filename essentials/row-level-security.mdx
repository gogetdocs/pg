Implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) and Data Masking in PostgreSQL involves understanding the basic concepts of each feature and then applying them to scenarios. Below, I will provide a detailed explanation of both concepts along with example implementations.

## Row-Level Security (RLS)

Row-Level Security (RLS) in PostgreSQL allows you to control access to rows in a database table based on the characteristics of the user making the query. This is particularly useful for multi-tenant applications where different users should only see data relevant to them.

### Basic Usage of Row-Level Security

1. **Creating a Table**: First, letâ€™s create a simple table to demonstrate RLS.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employee (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name TEXT NOT NULL,
       department TEXT NOT NULL,
       user_id INT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

2. **Enable Row-Level Security**: You need to enable RLS on the table.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE employee ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
   ```

3. **Create a Policy**: Define a policy to restrict which rows can be viewed by users.

   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY user_policy ON employee
   FOR SELECT
   USING (user_id = current_user_id()); -- Assuming current_user_id() returns the user ID of the logged-in user
   ```

4. **Testing the Policy**: Insert some sample data and test the policy.

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO employee (name, department, user_id) VALUES
   ('Alice', 'HR', 1),
   ('Bob', 'Finance', 2),
   ('Charlie', 'Engineering', 1);

   SET SESSION ROLE 'user_1'; -- Set to a role corresponding to user_id = 1
   SELECT * FROM employee; -- Should return Alice and Charlie's records only
   ```

### Advanced Usage of Row-Level Security

In more advanced scenarios, you can create multiple policies for different operations (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE).

1. **Create More Complex Policies**:

   ```sql
   CREATE POLICY insert_policy ON employee
   FOR INSERT
   WITH CHECK (user_id = current_user_id());

   CREATE POLICY update_policy ON employee
   FOR UPDATE
   USING (user_id = current_user_id());

   CREATE POLICY delete_policy ON employee
   FOR DELETE
   USING (user_id = current_user_id());
   ```

2. **Combine Multiple Policies**: You can use multiple policies together.

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE employee FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY; -- Enforce RLS policies for all operations
   ```

3. **Testing Combined Policies**: Test the INSERT and UPDATE operations.

   ```sql
   SET SESSION ROLE 'user_1';
   INSERT INTO employee (name, department, user_id) VALUES ('Eve', 'Sales', 1); -- Allowed
   INSERT INTO employee (name, department, user_id) VALUES ('Frank', 'Sales', 2); -- Not allowed

   UPDATE employee SET department = 'HR' WHERE id = 1; -- Allowed
   ```

## Data Masking

Data masking involves obscuring sensitive data within a database to protect it from unauthorized access. In PostgreSQL, you can achieve data masking using views and functions.

### Basic Usage of Data Masking

1. **Create a Table with Sensitive Data**:

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE customers (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name TEXT NOT NULL,
       email TEXT NOT NULL,
       phone TEXT NOT NULL,
       user_id INT NOT NULL
   );
   ```

2. **Insert Sample Data**:

   ```sql
   INSERT INTO customers (name, email, phone, user_id) VALUES
   ('Alice', 'alice@example.com', '123-456-7890', 1),
   ('Bob', 'bob@example.com', '234-567-8901', 2);
   ```

3. **Create a Masked View**: Create a view that masks the sensitive data.

   ```sql
   CREATE VIEW masked_customers AS
   SELECT
       id,
       name,
       CONCAT(SUBSTRING(email FROM 1 FOR 3), '****@****.com') AS email, -- Masking email
       CONCAT('***-***-', SUBSTRING(phone FROM 8 FOR 4)) AS phone, -- Masking phone
       user_id
   FROM customers;
   ```

4. **Accessing the Masked View**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM masked_customers;
   -- Results: name, masked email, masked phone
   ```

### Advanced Usage of Data Masking

For advanced data masking, you can implement dynamic masking based on user roles or use functions to handle more complex masking scenarios.

1. **Dynamic Masking Based on User Roles**:

   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION mask_email(email TEXT) RETURNS TEXT AS $$
   BEGIN
       IF current_user = 'admin' THEN
           RETURN email; -- Admin can see full email
       ELSE
           RETURN CONCAT(SUBSTRING(email FROM 1 FOR 3), '****@****.com'); -- Masked for regular users
       END IF;
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

   CREATE VIEW dynamic_masked_customers AS
   SELECT
       id,
       name,
       mask_email(email) AS email,
       phone,
       user_id
   FROM customers;
   ```

2. **Testing the Dynamic Masking**:

   ```sql
   SET SESSION ROLE 'user_1'; -- Non-admin
   SELECT * FROM dynamic_masked_customers; -- Should return masked email

   SET SESSION ROLE 'admin'; -- Admin user
   SELECT * FROM dynamic_masked_customers; -- Should return full email
   ```

### Summary

- **Row-Level Security** allows you to restrict data access at the row level, providing a robust mechanism to enforce security policies based on user characteristics.
- **Data Masking** protects sensitive information by obscuring it based on user roles or other criteria, ensuring that sensitive data is not exposed to unauthorized users.

By using these techniques in PostgreSQL, you can effectively manage data security and privacy within your applications.
