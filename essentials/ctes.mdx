Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in PostgreSQL are a powerful feature that allows for more organized and readable SQL queries, especially when dealing with complex logic. They can also improve performance by breaking down a query into smaller, manageable parts. Below are several complete, implementations of CTEs in PostgreSQL.

### 1. Recursive CTE for Hierarchical Data

A recursive CTE is often used for hierarchical data, such as organizational charts or category trees. Here’s an example where we have an employee table with a self-referential foreign key for managers.

#### Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    manager_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employees (id)
);
```

#### Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO employees (name, manager_id) VALUES
('Alice', NULL),
('Bob', 1),
('Charlie', 1),
('David', 2),
('Eve', 2),
('Frank', 3);
```

#### Recursive CTE Query

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT id, name, manager_id, 0 AS level
    FROM employees
    WHERE manager_id IS NULL  -- Start with top-level manager (CEO)

    UNION ALL

    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    INNER JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy ORDER BY level, name;
```

### Explanation:

- The CTE starts with the top-level employee (who has no manager) and then recursively joins to find all employees under that manager, incrementing the level each time.

### 2. CTE for Aggregating Data

CTEs can also be useful for aggregating data before using it in another query. Here’s an example with a sales database.

#### Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    sale_date DATE
);
```

#### Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO sales (product_id, quantity, sale_date) VALUES
(1, 10, '2024-01-01'),
(1, 20, '2024-01-02'),
(2, 15, '2024-01-01'),
(2, 25, '2024-01-03');
```

#### CTE for Daily Sales Aggregation

```sql
WITH daily_sales AS (
    SELECT sale_date, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY sale_date
)
SELECT sale_date, total_quantity,
       LAG(total_quantity) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS previous_day_quantity
FROM daily_sales
ORDER BY sale_date;
```

### Explanation:

- This CTE aggregates total sales per day and then uses the `LAG` window function to compare daily sales with the previous day’s sales.

### 3. CTE for Data Transformation and Final Selection

CTEs can also serve as a step for transforming data before the final selection. For example, consider transforming customer orders to calculate total revenue per customer.

#### Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE customers (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers (id)
);
```

#### Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO customers (name) VALUES
('John Doe'),
('Jane Smith');

INSERT INTO orders (customer_id, amount) VALUES
(1, 100.50),
(1, 200.75),
(2, 150.00);
```

#### CTE for Revenue Calculation

```sql
WITH customer_revenue AS (
    SELECT c.id AS customer_id, c.name, SUM(o.amount) AS total_revenue
    FROM customers c
    LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.id
)
SELECT cr.customer_id, cr.name, cr.total_revenue
FROM customer_revenue cr
WHERE cr.total_revenue > 100;
```

### Explanation:

- The CTE `customer_revenue` calculates total revenue for each customer, and the final query filters out customers with a total revenue of less than 100.

### 4. CTE for Complex Filtering and Joining

CTEs can help simplify complex queries involving multiple joins. Here’s an example with multiple tables.

#### Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_date DATE
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    product_id INT,
    quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders (id),
    FOREIGN KEY (product_id) REFERENCES products (id)
);
```

#### Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES
('Widget', 10.00),
('Gadget', 20.00);

INSERT INTO orders (order_date) VALUES
('2024-01-01'),
('2024-01-02');

INSERT INTO order_items (order_id, product_id, quantity) VALUES
(1, 1, 5),
(1, 2, 2),
(2, 1, 3);
```

#### CTE for Order Summary

```sql
WITH order_summary AS (
    SELECT o.id AS order_id,
           SUM(p.price * oi.quantity) AS total_price
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
    JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
    GROUP BY o.id
)
SELECT os.order_id, os.total_price
FROM order_summary os
WHERE os.total_price > 50;
```

### Explanation:

- The `order_summary` CTE calculates the total price for each order by joining the `orders`, `order_items`, and `products` tables, then filters for orders exceeding a total price of 50.

### 5. CTE for Window Function Use

CTEs are also useful when dealing with window functions. For example, calculating running totals for sales.

#### CTE for Running Total

```sql
WITH sales_data AS (
    SELECT sale_date,
           SUM(quantity) AS daily_quantity
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY sale_date
)
SELECT sale_date,
       daily_quantity,
       SUM(daily_quantity) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date) AS running_total
FROM sales_data
ORDER BY sale_date;
```

### Explanation:

- This query first aggregates daily sales and then calculates a running total of those daily sales using a window function.

---

### 6. CTE for Pagination

CTEs can be useful for implementing pagination in SQL queries, especially when combined with `ROW_NUMBER()`.

#### CTE for Pagination Example

```sql
WITH paginated_orders AS (
    SELECT id, customer_id, order_date,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY order_date DESC) AS row_num
    FROM orders
)
SELECT *
FROM paginated_orders
WHERE row_num BETWEEN 1 AND 10;  -- Retrieve the first 10 orders
```

### Explanation:

- The `ROW_NUMBER()` function assigns a unique number to each row based on the order date, allowing easy pagination of results.

---

### 7. CTE for Filtering Hierarchical Data

You can use CTEs to filter hierarchical data more easily. This is especially useful when working with category or product hierarchies.

#### Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE categories (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    parent_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (parent_id) REFERENCES categories (id)
);
```

#### Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO categories (name, parent_id) VALUES
('Electronics', NULL),
('Laptops', 1),
('Smartphones', 1),
('Dell', 2),
('HP', 2),
('Apple', 3);
```

#### CTE for Filtering Hierarchical Data

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE category_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT id, name, parent_id
    FROM categories
    WHERE name = 'Electronics'  -- Start from a specific category

    UNION ALL

    SELECT c.id, c.name, c.parent_id
    FROM categories c
    INNER JOIN category_hierarchy ch ON c.parent_id = ch.id
)
SELECT * FROM category_hierarchy;
```

### Explanation:

- This CTE retrieves all categories under "Electronics," including subcategories.

### 8. CTE for Complex Calculations

CTEs can break down complex calculations into simpler steps, making your queries more readable.

#### CTE for Profit Calculation

```sql
WITH product_sales AS (
    SELECT product_id, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
    FROM orders o
    JOIN order_items oi ON o.id = oi.order_id
    GROUP BY product_id
),
product_costs AS (
    SELECT product_id, SUM(cost) AS total_cost
    FROM product_costs_table  -- Assume this table exists
    GROUP BY product_id
)
SELECT ps.product_id,
       ps.total_sales - pc.total_cost AS profit
FROM product_sales ps
JOIN product_costs pc ON ps.product_id = pc.product_id;
```

### Explanation:

- The CTEs `product_sales` and `product_costs` calculate total sales and costs per product, and the final query computes the profit.

---

### 9. CTE for Data Comparison

CTEs can help compare current data against historical data for trends or changes.

#### Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE historical_sales (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    product_id INT,
    sale_date DATE,
    amount DECIMAL
);
```

#### Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO historical_sales (product_id, sale_date, amount) VALUES
(1, '2023-10-01', 500.00),
(2, '2023-10-01', 300.00),
(1, '2023-10-02', 450.00),
(2, '2023-10-02', 350.00);
```

#### CTE for Data Comparison

```sql
WITH current_sales AS (
    SELECT product_id, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
    FROM sales
    WHERE sale_date >= '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY product_id
),
historical_sales_summary AS (
    SELECT product_id, SUM(amount) AS total_amount
    FROM historical_sales
    WHERE sale_date >= '2023-10-01' AND sale_date < '2024-01-01'
    GROUP BY product_id
)
SELECT cs.product_id,
       cs.total_amount AS current_total,
       hs.total_amount AS historical_total,
       (cs.total_amount - hs.total_amount) AS difference
FROM current_sales cs
LEFT JOIN historical_sales_summary hs ON cs.product_id = hs.product_id;
```

### Explanation:

- The CTEs compare current sales with historical sales, allowing analysis of trends over time.

           AVG(total_amount) OVER (ORDER BY sale_date ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS seven_day_avg
    FROM daily_sales
)
SELECT * FROM running_average;
```

### Explanation:

- The CTE `daily_sales` calculates daily totals, while the `running_average` computes a 7-day moving average.

---

### 12. CTE for Aggregated Metrics

CTEs can be used to create aggregated metrics for reporting purposes, such as monthly performance.

#### CTE for Monthly Sales Summary

```sql
WITH monthly_sales AS (
    SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) AS month,
           SUM(amount) AS total_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY month
)
SELECT month,
       total_sales,
       LAG(total_sales) OVER (ORDER BY month) AS previous_month_sales
FROM monthly_sales;
```

### Explanation:

- This CTE summarizes sales by month and compares each month's total to the previous month.

---

### 13. CTE for Data Deduplication

CTEs can help identify and remove duplicate records in a table.

#### Table Structure

```sql
WITH ranked_profiles AS (
    SELECT id, email, name,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY email ORDER BY created_at DESC) AS rank
    FROM user_profiles
)
DELETE FROM user_profiles
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM ranked_profiles WHERE rank > 1);
```

### Explanation:

- This CTE identifies duplicate profiles based on email and retains only the most recent entry based on the `created_at` timestamp.

---

### 14. CTE for Calculating Percentiles

CTEs can be useful for calculating percentiles or quantiles for data analysis.

WHERE amount > 100;
```

### Explanation:

- This CTE acts as a temporary table that combines order and customer data, allowing for simplified querying without creating a physical table.

---

### 22. CTE for Cross-Tabulation

CTEs can be used to create cross-tabulations or pivot tables to analyze data from different perspectives.

#### Cross-Tabulation Example

```sql
WITH sales_data AS (
    SELECT product_id,
           EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) AS sale_month,
           SUM(amount) AS total_sales
    FROM sales
    GROUP BY product_id, sale_month
)
SELECT product_id,
       SUM(CASE WHEN sale_month = 1 THEN total_sales ELSE 0 END) AS January,
       SUM(CASE WHEN sale_month = 2 THEN total_sales ELSE 0 END) AS February,
       SUM(CASE WHEN sale_month = 3 THEN total_sales ELSE 0 END) AS March
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY product_id;
