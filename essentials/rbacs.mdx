Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in PostgreSQL is a powerful mechanism for managing user permissions and access rights in a database environment. It allows for defining roles and privileges, which can be assigned to users or other roles, facilitating granular control over what each user can do within the database.

Here's a comprehensive overview of both basic and advanced usages of RBAC in PostgreSQL, including complete implementations.

### Basic Implementation of RBAC

1. **Creating Roles**

   - Create roles to represent groups of users or specific access levels.

   ```sql
   -- Create roles
   CREATE ROLE read_only;
   CREATE ROLE read_write;
   ```

2. **Creating Users**

   - Create users and assign them to roles.

   ```sql
   -- Create users
   CREATE USER alice WITH PASSWORD 'password';
   CREATE USER bob WITH PASSWORD 'password';

   -- Grant roles to users
   GRANT read_only TO alice;
   GRANT read_write TO bob;
   ```

3. **Granting Privileges**

   - Define what privileges each role has on specific database objects.

   ```sql
   -- Create a sample table
   CREATE TABLE products (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100),
       price NUMERIC
   );

   -- Grant privileges
   GRANT SELECT ON products TO read_only;
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON products TO read_write;
   ```

4. **Using Roles for Security**

   - When users connect, they will have the privileges assigned to their roles.

   ```sql
   -- As alice
   \c my_database alice
   SELECT * FROM products;  -- Works
   INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('New Product', 10.99);  -- Fails

   -- As bob
   \c my_database bob
   SELECT * FROM products;  -- Works
   INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES ('Another Product', 15.99);  -- Works
   ```

### Advanced Implementation of RBAC

1. **Role Hierarchies**

   - Create role hierarchies where roles can inherit privileges from other roles.

   ```sql
   -- Create a role that inherits from others
   CREATE ROLE manager IN ROLE read_write;
   ```

   - Now, `manager` will have both `read_write` and `read_only` permissions.

2. **Defining Role Attributes**

   - Set attributes like LOGIN, CREATEDB, or SUPERUSER for roles.

   ```sql
   -- Create roles with attributes
   CREATE ROLE app_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'securepassword' CREATEDB;
   ```

3. **Revoking Privileges**

   - Revoke privileges when necessary to maintain security.

   ```sql
   -- Revoke SELECT from read_only
   REVOKE SELECT ON products FROM read_only;
   ```

4. **Creating Policies for Row-Level Security (RLS)**

   - Implement row-level security policies to restrict access to rows based on user roles.

   ```sql
   -- Enable RLS on the products table
   ALTER TABLE products ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   -- Create a policy
   CREATE POLICY user_policy ON products
   FOR SELECT
   USING (user_id = current_user);  -- Assume user_id is a column that relates to the user
   ```

5. **Using `SET ROLE` for Temporary Role Changes**

   - Switch roles dynamically to access different privileges within a session.

   ```sql
   -- Switch to another role temporarily
   SET ROLE read_write;
   SELECT * FROM products;  -- Works with read_write privileges
   RESET ROLE;  -- Revert to original role
   ```

6. **Combining with Function Security**

   - Define functions with specific security definer and invoker behaviors.

   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION secure_insert_product(name VARCHAR, price NUMERIC)
   RETURNS VOID AS $$
   BEGIN
       INSERT INTO products (name, price) VALUES (name, price);
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;  -- Run with the privileges of the function owner
   ```

### Full-fledged Example

Hereâ€™s a more comprehensive scenario that integrates all the aforementioned concepts:

1. **Setup Database and Roles**

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE company_db;
   \c company_db

   CREATE ROLE hr_read_only;
   CREATE ROLE hr_read_write;

   CREATE USER alice WITH PASSWORD 'alice_password';
   CREATE USER bob WITH PASSWORD 'bob_password';

   GRANT hr_read_only TO alice;
   GRANT hr_read_write TO bob;
   ```

2. **Create Tables and Grant Privileges**

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (
       id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
       name VARCHAR(100),
       salary NUMERIC,
       department VARCHAR(50)
   );

   -- Grant permissions
   GRANT SELECT ON employees TO hr_read_only;
   GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON employees TO hr_read_write;
   ```

3. **Implement Row-Level Security**

   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE employees ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

   CREATE POLICY employee_policy ON employees
   FOR SELECT
   USING (department = current_user);
   ```

4. **Function for Secure Insert**

   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION secure_insert_employee(name VARCHAR, salary NUMERIC, department VARCHAR)
   RETURNS VOID AS $$
   BEGIN
       INSERT INTO employees (name, salary, department) VALUES (name, salary, department);
   END;
   $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
   ```

5. **Testing the Implementation**

   ```sql
   -- Connect as alice
   \c company_db alice
   SET ROLE hr_read_only;
   SELECT * FROM employees;  -- Works, but restricted by RLS

   -- Connect as bob
   \c company_db bob
   SET ROLE hr_read_write;
   INSERT INTO employees (name, salary, department) VALUES ('John Doe', 60000, 'IT');  -- Works
   ```
