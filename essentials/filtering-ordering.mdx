Filtering and ordering data are fundamental operations in SQL databases like PostgreSQL. Below, Iâ€™ll outline some basic and advanced usages of these operations, along with complete implementations for each concept.

### Basics of Filtering and Ordering

#### 1. Basic Filtering with `WHERE`

Filtering data allows you to retrieve only the rows that meet certain conditions. The `WHERE` clause is used for this purpose.

**Example**: Selecting users older than 25 from a `users` table.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE age > 25;
```

#### 2. Basic Ordering with `ORDER BY`

Ordering data allows you to sort the results based on one or more columns. The `ORDER BY` clause is used to specify the sort order.

**Example**: Selecting all users and ordering them by their registration date in descending order.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
ORDER BY registration_date DESC;
```

### Advanced Usages

#### 3. Combining Filtering and Ordering

You can combine `WHERE` and `ORDER BY` clauses to filter and sort your results simultaneously.

**Example**: Selecting users older than 25 and ordering them by name alphabetically.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE age > 25
ORDER BY name ASC;
```

#### 4. Using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`

The `LIMIT` clause restricts the number of rows returned by a query, while `OFFSET` allows you to skip a specific number of rows.

**Example**: Get the first 10 users older than 25.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE age > 25
ORDER BY name ASC
LIMIT 10;
```

#### 5. Using Cursors for Pagination

Cursors can be used for pagination in large datasets. They allow you to fetch a small number of rows at a time, which is useful in web applications.

**Example**: Using cursors to paginate through a result set.

```sql
BEGIN;

DECLARE user_cursor CURSOR FOR
SELECT *
FROM users
ORDER BY registration_date DESC;

FETCH FORWARD 10 FROM user_cursor;  -- Get the first 10 records
FETCH FORWARD 10 FROM user_cursor;  -- Get the next 10 records

CLOSE user_cursor;
COMMIT;
```

### Sophisticated Techniques

#### 6. Window Functions for Advanced Ordering

Window functions allow you to perform calculations across a set of table rows that are somehow related to the current row.

**Example**: Using the `ROW_NUMBER()` function to assign a rank to users based on their age.

```sql
SELECT name, age,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY age DESC) AS age_rank
FROM users;
```

#### 7. Filtering with Subqueries

You can use subqueries to filter results based on the results of another query.

**Example**: Selecting users who have a higher age than the average age of users.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE age > (SELECT AVG(age) FROM users);
```

#### 8. Common Table Expressions (CTEs)

CTEs provide a way to write complex queries in a more readable format. You can use CTEs to create temporary result sets.

**Example**: Using CTEs to find users and their corresponding age ranks.

```sql
WITH ranked_users AS (
    SELECT name, age,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY age DESC) AS age_rank
    FROM users
)
SELECT *
FROM ranked_users
WHERE age_rank <= 10;  -- Get top 10 oldest users
```

#### 9. Filtering and Ordering with JSONB Data Types

PostgreSQL supports JSONB, allowing you to filter and order based on JSON data.

**Example**: Assuming `users` has a JSONB column `preferences`.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE preferences ->> 'language' = 'English'
ORDER BY preferences ->> 'last_login' DESC;
```

### Full-Fledged Implementation Example

Let's implement a scenario where we create a `users` table, insert some data, and apply various filtering and ordering techniques.

#### Step 1: Create the Table

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    registration_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    preferences JSONB
);
```

#### Step 2: Insert Sample Data

```sql
INSERT INTO users (name, age, preferences)
VALUES
    ('Alice', 30, '{"language": "English", "last_login": "2024-09-30T12:00:00Z"}'),
    ('Bob', 24, '{"language": "Spanish", "last_login": "2024-09-29T09:30:00Z"}'),
    ('Charlie', 35, '{"language": "English", "last_login": "2024-09-28T15:20:00Z"}'),
    ('Diana', 28, '{"language": "French", "last_login": "2024-09-27T08:00:00Z"}');
```

#### Step 3: Query the Data with Filtering and Ordering

```sql
-- Get users older than 25 and order by registration date
SELECT *
FROM users
WHERE age > 25
ORDER BY registration_date DESC;
```

#### Step 4: Use a CTE to Rank Users by Age

```sql
WITH ranked_users AS (
    SELECT name, age,
           ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY age DESC) AS age_rank
    FROM users
)
SELECT *
FROM ranked_users
WHERE age_rank <= 3;  -- Get top 3 oldest users
```
