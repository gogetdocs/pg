### 15.4. Parallel Safety

#### 15.4.1. Parallel Labeling for Functions and Aggregates

The planner classifies operations involved in a query as either parallel safe, parallel restricted, or parallel unsafe. A parallel safe operation is one that does not conflict with the use of parallel query. A parallel restricted operation is one that cannot be performed in a parallel worker, but that can be performed in the leader while parallel query is in use. Therefore, parallel restricted operations can never occur below a `Gather` or `Gather Merge` node, but can occur elsewhere in a plan that contains such a node. A parallel unsafe operation is one that cannot be performed while parallel query is in use, not even in the leader. When a query contains anything that is parallel unsafe, parallel query is completely disabled for that query.

### Parallel Restricted Operations

The following operations are always parallel restricted:

- **Scans of Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** These cannot be performed in parallel workers.
- **Scans of Temporary Tables:** Temporary tables are not accessible in parallel mode.
- **Scans of Foreign Tables:** Unless the foreign data wrapper has an `IsForeignScanParallelSafe` API that indicates otherwise.
- **Plan Nodes with InitPlan:** These are not parallelizable.
- **Plan Nodes Referencing Correlated SubPlans:** These operations are restricted to the leader process.

### Labeling Functions and Aggregates

The planner cannot automatically determine whether a user-defined function or aggregate is parallel safe, parallel restricted, or parallel unsafe. Therefore, all user-defined functions are assumed to be parallel unsafe unless otherwise marked using `CREATE FUNCTION` or `ALTER FUNCTION` with `PARALLEL SAFE`, `PARALLEL RESTRICTED`, or `PARALLEL UNSAFE`. For aggregates, the `PARALLEL` option can be specified with `SAFE`, `RESTRICTED`, or `UNSAFE` in `CREATE AGGREGATE`.

### Guidelines for Labeling

- **PARALLEL UNSAFE:** Use for functions that write to the database, access sequences, change the transaction state, or make persistent changes to settings.
- **PARALLEL RESTRICTED:** Use for functions that access temporary tables, client connection state, cursors, prepared statements, or miscellaneous backend-local state.

### Example Usage

#### Creating a Parallel Safe Function

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calc_factorial(a integer, fact_val integer) RETURNS integer AS $$
BEGIN
    PERFORM (fact_val)!;
    RETURN a;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql PARALLEL SAFE;
```

#### Using the Parallel Safe Function in a Query

```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT c1 FROM tbl_perf WHERE c1 > calc_factorial(10000, 10) AND c2 LIKE '%aa%';
```

#### Creating a Parallel Restricted Function

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION set_random_seed() RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    PERFORM setseed(0.5);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql PARALLEL RESTRICTED;
```

#### Creating a Parallel Unsafe Function

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_table() RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE tbl_perf SET c1 = c1 + 1;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql PARALLEL UNSAFE;
```

### Important Considerations

- **Locks in Parallel Workers:** If a function acquires locks not held by the leader, those locks will be released at worker exit, not end of transaction. Mark such functions as `PARALLEL RESTRICTED`.
- **Query Planning:** The planner does not consider deferring the evaluation of parallel-restricted functions or aggregates to obtain a superior plan. Therefore, parallel restricted operations in a `WHERE` clause will prevent the table scan from being included in the parallel portion of the query.

### Usage

#### Impact of Parallel Safety on Query Performance

```sql
-- Create a table for performance testing
CREATE TABLE tbl_perf(c1 int, c2 char(1000));
INSERT INTO tbl_perf VALUES(generate_series(1,30000000),'aaaaa');

-- Explain analyze the query with parallel safe function
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT c1 FROM tbl_perf WHERE c1 > calc_factorial(10000, 10) AND c2 LIKE '%aa%';

-- Alter the function to parallel unsafe and re-analyze
ALTER FUNCTION calc_factorial(integer, integer) PARALLEL UNSAFE;
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT c1 FROM tbl_perf WHERE c1 > calc_factorial(10000, 10) AND c2 LIKE '%aa%';
```

This demonstrates how parallel safety affects query planning and performance. Using parallel safe functions allows the query planner to utilize parallel workers, significantly improving execution times for large datasets[2][3].
