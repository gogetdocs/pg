# **Parallel Query in PostgreSQL: Configuration and Limitations**

### Overview

PostgreSQL provides parallel query capabilities to improve performance on multi-core systems. However, there are specific settings and conditions that must be met for parallel query plans to be generated and executed.

### Configuration Settings

To enable parallel query plans, the following settings must be configured:

- `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` must be set to a value greater than zero.
- The system must not be running in single-user mode.

**Example: Enabling Parallel Query**

```sql
-- Set max_parallel_workers_per_gather to 4
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;

-- Restart the PostgreSQL server to apply the changes
pg_ctl restart
```

### Limitations

Even when parallel query plans are enabled, the planner will not generate them for a given query if any of the following conditions are true:

- The query writes any data or locks any database rows.
- The query might be suspended during execution (e.g., using a cursor or a PL/pgSQL loop).
- The query uses any function marked `PARALLEL UNSAFE`.
- The query is running inside another query that is already parallel.

**Example: Parallel Query with CREATE TABLE**

```sql
-- Create a new table using a parallel query plan
CREATE TABLE my_table AS
SELECT * FROM large_table;
```

In this example, the `CREATE TABLE` statement can use a parallel query plan for the underlying `SELECT` statement.

### Execution Time Limitations

Even when a parallel query plan is generated, there are circumstances under which it will be impossible to execute that plan in parallel at execution time. These include:

- No background workers can be obtained due to the `max_worker_processes` or `max_parallel_workers` limitations.
- The client sends an `Execute` message with a non-zero fetch count.

**Example: Disabling Parallel Query for a Session**

```sql
-- Set max_parallel_workers_per_gather to 0 for the current session
SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 0;

-- Execute a query that would normally use a parallel plan
SELECT * FROM large_table;
```

In this example, the query will be executed serially, even if a parallel query plan was generated.

### Usage

To demonstrate the usage of parallel query in PostgreSQL, let's create a large table and execute a query that can benefit from parallel execution.

```sql
-- Create a large table
CREATE TABLE large_table AS
SELECT * FROM generate_series(1, 1000000);

-- Enable parallel query for the current session
SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;

-- Execute a query that can benefit from parallel execution
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, VERBOSE) SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE column1 > 500000;
```

In this example, the query will be executed in parallel, using multiple background workers to improve performance.

Note: The `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, VERBOSE)` statement is used to display the query plan and execution time. The `VERBOSE` option provides additional information about the query plan.
