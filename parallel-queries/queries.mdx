# **Parallel Query in PostgreSQL**

## **How Parallel Query Works**

When the optimizer determines that parallel query is the fastest execution strategy for a particular query, it will create a query plan that includes a `Gather` or `Gather Merge` node.

### Example

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM pgbench_accounts WHERE filler LIKE '%x%';
```

Output:

```sql
                                     QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​------------------
 Gather  (cost=1000.00..217018.43 rows=1 width=97)
   Workers Planned: 2
   ->  Parallel Seq Scan on pgbench_accounts  (cost=0.00..216018.33 rows=1 width=97)
         Filter: (filler ~~ '%x%'::text)
(4 rows)
```

In this example, the query accesses only one table, so there is only one plan node other than the `Gather` node itself. Since that plan node is a child of the `Gather` node, it will run in parallel.

### Understanding the Query Plan

- The `Gather` node will have exactly one child plan, which is the portion of the plan that will be executed in parallel.
- If the `Gather` node is at the very top of the plan tree, then the entire query will execute in parallel.
- If it is somewhere else in the plan tree, then only the portion of the plan below it will run in parallel.

### Using EXPLAIN to Analyze Parallel Query

Using `EXPLAIN`, you can see the number of workers chosen by the planner.

```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) SELECT * FROM pgbench_accounts WHERE filler LIKE '%x%';
```

Output:

```sql
                                     QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​------------------
 Gather  (cost=1000.00..217018.43 rows=1 width=97)
   Workers Planned: 2
   ->  Parallel Seq Scan on pgbench_accounts  (cost=0.00..216018.33 rows=1 width=97)
         Filter: (filler ~~ '%x%'::text)
 Planning Time: 0.123 ms
 Execution Time: 1.234 ms
(6 rows)
```

### Configuring Parallel Query

The number of background workers that the planner will consider using is limited to at most `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`. The total number of background workers that can exist at any one time is limited by both `max_worker_processes` and `max_parallel_workers`.

To configure parallel query, you can adjust the following parameters:

- `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`: sets the maximum number of workers that can be used for a single gather operation.
- `max_worker_processes`: sets the maximum number of worker processes that can exist at any one time.
- `max_parallel_workers`: sets the maximum number of parallel workers that can exist at any one time.

### Example

Suppose we have a large table `orders` with millions of rows, and we want to run a query that filters orders by date and calculates the total revenue.

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  date DATE NOT NULL,
  revenue DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL
);

INSERT INTO orders (date, revenue)
VALUES ('2022-01-01', 100.00),
       ('2022-01-02', 200.00),
       ('2022-01-03', 300.00),
       -- ...
       ('2022-12-31', 1000.00);

EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) SELECT SUM(revenue) FROM orders WHERE date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31';
```

Output:

```sql
                                     QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​------------------
 Gather  (cost=1000.00..217018.43 rows=1 width=97)
   Workers Planned: 4
   ->  Parallel Seq Scan on orders  (cost=0.00..216018.33 rows=1 width=97)
         Filter: (date >= '2022-01-01'::date AND date <= '2022-12-31'::date)
 Planning Time: 0.123 ms
 Execution Time: 10.234 ms
(6 rows)
```

In this example, the query uses 4 workers to scan the `orders` table in parallel, which significantly improves the execution time.

### Using Gather Merge

When the node at the top of the parallel portion of the plan is `Gather Merge` rather than `Gather`, it indicates that each process executing the parallel portion of the plan is producing tuples in sorted order, and that the leader is performing an order-preserving merge.

```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) SELECT * FROM orders WHERE date BETWEEN '2022-01-01' AND '2022-12-31' ORDER BY date;
```

Output:

```sql
                                     QUERY PLAN
-------------------------------------------------------------------​------------------
 Gather Merge  (cost=1000.00..217018.43 rows=1 width=97)
   Workers Planned: 4
   ->  Parallel Seq Scan on orders  (cost=0.00..216018.33 rows=1 width=97)
         Filter: (date >= '2022-01-01'::date AND date <= '2022-12-31'::date)
         Order By: date
 Planning Time: 0.123 ms
 Execution Time: 10.234 ms
(6 rows)
```

In this example, the query uses 4 workers to scan the `orders` table in parallel, and the leader performs an order-preserving merge to produce the final sorted result.
