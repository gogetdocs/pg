## PostgreSQL Window Functions

### Overview

Window functions in PostgreSQL allow for calculations across sets of rows related to the current query row. They are powerful tools that simplify complex queries and enhance efficiency by processing analyses directly within the database server[2][4].

### Syntax

The basic syntax of a window function includes:

- **window_function(arg1, arg2, ...)**: The name of the window function, such as `SUM()`, `ROW_NUMBER()`, `AVG()`, etc.
- **OVER**: This clause defines the set of rows on which the function operates.
  - **PARTITION BY**: Divides the result set into partitions to which the window function is applied separately. It is optional[1][3].
  - **ORDER BY**: Specifies the ordering of rows within each partition. It determines the frame from which the window function operates. It is also optional[1][3].
  - **frame_clause**: Specifies the window frame, i.e., the set of rows within the partition relative to the current row, over which the function operates. It is optional and allows for more precise control over the window[1][3].

### Types of Window Functions

1. **Ranking Functions**

   - **RANK()**: Assigns a unique rank to each distinct row within the partition, with gaps in ranking[1][6].
   - **DENSE_RANK()**: Similar to `RANK()`, but with no gaps in ranking[1][6].
   - **ROW_NUMBER()**: Assigns a unique sequential integer to each row within the partition[1][6].

2. **Aggregate Functions**

   - **SUM()**, **AVG()**, **MIN()**, **MAX()**: Compute aggregate values over the window[1][6].
   - **COUNT()**: Counts the number of rows in the window[1][6].

3. **Lead and Lag Functions**

   - **LEAD()**: Accesses data from subsequent rows[1][6].
   - **LAG()**: Accesses data from preceding rows[1][6].

4. **Window Frame Functions**

   - **FIRST_VALUE()**: Returns the first value in the window frame[1][6].
   - **LAST_VALUE()**: Returns the last value in the window frame[1][6].
   - **NTH_VALUE()**: Returns the value of a specific row within the window frame[1][6].

5. **Percentile Functions**

   - **PERCENT_RANK()**: Computes the relative rank of a value within a group of values[1][6].
   - **CUME_DIST()**: Computes the cumulative distribution of a value within a group of values[1][6].

6. **Distribution Functions**
   - **CUME_DIST()**: Cumulative distribution[1][6].
   - **NTILE()**: Divides the partition into n rank groups[1][6].

### Usage Examples

#### Example 1: Using ROW_NUMBER() to Assign Unique Row Numbers

```sql
SELECT product_name, group_name, price,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY group_name ORDER BY price) AS row_number
FROM products
INNER JOIN product_groups USING (group_id);
```

This query calculates the row number for each product within its respective group, ordered by price[1].

#### Example 2: Calculating Running Totals

```sql
SELECT salary, SUM(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS running_total
FROM empsalary;
```

This query computes the running total of salaries, ordered by salary[4].

#### Example 3: Comparing Salaries with Department Averages

```sql
SELECT depname, empno, salary,
       AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY depname) AS avg_salary
FROM empsalary;
```

This query compares each employee's salary with the average salary in their department[4].

#### Example 4: Using Multiple Window Functions with a WINDOW Clause

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) OVER w, AVG(salary) OVER w
FROM empsalary
WINDOW w AS (PARTITION BY depname ORDER BY salary DESC);
```

This query uses multiple window functions with a `WINDOW` clause to simplify the query and avoid duplicating the window specification[4].

### Additional Considerations

- **Frame Specifications**: The `frame_clause` can be used to define a subset of rows in the current partition to which the window function is applied. This can include `ROWS`, `RANGE`, or `GROUPS` specifications[3][4].
- **Aggregate Functions as Window Functions**: Any built-in or user-defined ordinary aggregate can be used as a window function by including an `OVER` clause[6].
- **SQL Standard Compliance**: PostgreSQL does not implement the `RESPECT NULLS` or `IGNORE NULLS` option for `LEAD`, `LAG`, `FIRST_VALUE`, `LAST_VALUE`, and `NTH_VALUE` functions. The behavior is always the same as the standard's default, namely `RESPECT NULLS`[6].
