# **PostgreSQL Conditional Expressions Documentation**

### Overview

PostgreSQL provides several conditional expressions that can be used to select one of multiple values based on a boolean condition. These expressions include `CASE`, `COALESCE`, `NULLIF`, `GREATEST`, and `LEAST`.

### 9.18.1. CASE

The `CASE` expression is a generic conditional expression, similar to if/else statements in other programming languages.

**Syntax:**

```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition THEN result
    [WHEN ...]
    [ELSE result]
END
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT a,
       CASE WHEN a=1 THEN 'one'
            WHEN a=2 THEN 'two'
            ELSE 'other'
       END
    FROM test;
```

Result:

```
 a | case
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
 3 | other
```

**usage:**

Suppose we want to categorize customers based on their total purchases:

```sql
SELECT customer_name,
       CASE
           WHEN total_purchases > 1000 THEN 'VIP'
           WHEN total_purchases > 500 THEN 'Preferred'
           ELSE 'Regular'
       END AS customer_category
    FROM customers;
```

### 9.18.2. COALESCE

The `COALESCE` function returns the first of its arguments that is not null.

**Syntax:**

```sql
COALESCE(value [, ...])
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(description, short_description, '(none)') ...
```

This returns `description` if it is not null, otherwise `short_description` if it is not null, otherwise `(none)`.

**usage:**

Suppose we want to display a product's description, but if it is null, display the short description instead:

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(description, short_description, '(none)') AS product_description
    FROM products;
```

### 9.18.3. NULLIF

The `NULLIF` function returns a null value if `value1` equals `value2`; otherwise it returns `value1`.

**Syntax:**

```sql
NULLIF(value1, value2)
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT NULLIF(value, '(none)') ...
```

This returns null if `value` is `(none)`, otherwise it returns `value`.

**usage:**

Suppose we want to replace a specific value with null:

```sql
SELECT NULLIF(description, '(none)') AS product_description
    FROM products;
```

### 9.18.4. GREATEST and LEAST

The `GREATEST` and `LEAST` functions select the largest or smallest value from a list of any number of expressions.

**Syntax:**

```sql
GREATEST(value [, ...])
LEAST(value [, ...])
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT GREATEST(a, b, c) ...
```

This returns the largest value among `a`, `b`, and `c`.

**usage:**

Suppose we want to find the highest price among several products:

```sql
SELECT GREATEST(price1, price2, price3) AS highest_price
    FROM products;
```

Note that `GREATEST` and `LEAST` are not in the SQL standard, but are a common extension. Some other databases make them return NULL if any argument is NULL, rather than only when all are NULL[5].
