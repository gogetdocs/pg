## PostgreSQL Sequence Manipulation Functions

### Overview

PostgreSQL sequence objects are special single-row tables created with `CREATE SEQUENCE`. They are commonly used to generate unique identifiers for rows of a table. The sequence functions provide simple, multiuser-safe methods for obtaining successive sequence values from sequence objects.

### Sequence Functions

#### 1. `nextval(regclass) → bigint`

Advances the sequence object to its next value and returns that value. This is done atomically: even if multiple sessions execute `nextval` concurrently, each will safely receive a distinct sequence value.

**Example:**

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE myseq;
SELECT nextval('myseq');  -- Returns 1
SELECT nextval('myseq');  -- Returns 2
```

#### 2. `setval(regclass, bigint [, boolean ]) → bigint`

Sets the sequence object's current value, and optionally its `is_called` flag.

- **Two-parameter form:** Sets the sequence's `last_value` field to the specified value and sets its `is_called` field to `true`, meaning that the next `nextval` will advance the sequence before returning a value.
- **Three-parameter form:** Allows setting `is_called` to `true` or `false`. If `false`, the next `nextval` will return exactly the specified value, and sequence advancement commences with the following `nextval`.

**Examples:**

```sql
SELECT setval('myseq', 42);           -- Next nextval will return 43
SELECT setval('myseq', 42, true);     -- Same as above
SELECT setval('myseq', 42, false);    -- Next nextval will return 42
```

#### 3. `currval(regclass) → bigint`

Returns the value most recently obtained by `nextval` for this sequence in the current session. An error is reported if `nextval` has never been called for this sequence in this session.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT nextval('myseq');  -- Returns 1
SELECT currval('myseq');  -- Returns 1
```

#### 4. `lastval() → bigint`

Returns the value most recently returned by `nextval` in the current session. This function is identical to `currval`, except that instead of taking the sequence name as an argument, it refers to whichever sequence `nextval` was most recently applied to in the current session.

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT nextval('myseq');  -- Returns 1
SELECT lastval();         -- Returns 1
```

### Important Considerations

- **Gaps in Sequences:** Transaction aborts or database crashes can result in gaps in the sequence of assigned values. This can happen without a transaction abort, too, such as with an `INSERT` with an `ON CONFLICT` clause.
- **Sequence State Changes:** Changes made by `setval` are immediately visible to other transactions and are not undone if the calling transaction rolls back.
- **Database Cluster Crashes:** If the database cluster crashes before committing a transaction containing a `nextval` or `setval` call, the sequence state change might not have made its way to persistent storage, leading to uncertainty about the sequence's state after the cluster restarts.

### Usage

#### Using Sequences with Tables

Sequences can be used to generate values for the `INT` column of a table. Here’s an example of creating a sequence and associating it with a table’s column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
    emp_id INT,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE SEQUENCE employee_seq
    START 10
    INCREMENT 5
    MINVALUE 10
    OWNED BY employee.emp_id;

INSERT INTO employee (emp_id, first_name, last_name, email)
VALUES (nextval('employee_seq'), 'John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@example.com');
```

#### Using `serial` Pseudo-Datatype

The `serial` pseudo-datatype can be used to create a sequence and associate it with a table’s column automatically:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    age INT4
);

INSERT INTO users (name, age)
VALUES ('Mozart', 20);
```

In this case, the sequence is automatically assigned the name `users_id_seq`, and the `id` column is set to use this sequence for its default value.
