## PostgreSQL Event Triggers: A Comprehensive Guide

PostgreSQL event triggers are a powerful mechanism that allows you to react to database schema changes, such as table or column addition and deletion, object creation, and more. Unlike regular triggers, which are attached to a single table and capture only DML events, event triggers are global to a particular database and can capture DDL events.

### Supported Events

PostgreSQL supports the following events for event triggers:

- **ddl_command_start**: Occurs just before the execution of a `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, etc., command.
- **ddl_command_end**: Occurs just after the execution of a `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, etc., command.
- **sql_drop**: Occurs just before the `ddl_command_end` event trigger for any operation that drops database objects.
- **table_rewrite**: Occurs just before a table is rewritten by some actions of the commands `ALTER TABLE` and `ALTER TYPE`.

### Creating Event Triggers

To create an event trigger, you first need to create a trigger function that defines the logic to be executed when the trigger fires. This function must return `event_trigger` and can be written in any procedural language supported by PostgreSQL, such as PL/pgSQL.

Here is an example of creating a trigger function and an event trigger:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_ddl()
RETURNS event_trigger AS $$
DECLARE
    r RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR r IN SELECT * FROM pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands()
    LOOP
        INSERT INTO ddl_history (ddl_date, ddl_tag, object_name)
        VALUES (statement_timestamp(), tg_tag, r.object_identity);
    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE EVENT TRIGGER log_ddl_info
ON ddl_command_end
EXECUTE FUNCTION log_ddl();
```

### Helper Functions

PostgreSQL provides several helper functions to retrieve information from event triggers:

- **pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands()**: Returns a list of DDL commands executed by each user action, when invoked in a function attached to a `ddl_command_end` event trigger[2][4].
- **pg_event_trigger_dropped_objects()**: Returns a list of all objects dropped by the command in whose `sql_drop` event it is called[2][4].
- **pg_event_trigger_table_rewrite_oid()** and **pg_event_trigger_table_rewrite_reason()**: Provide information about a table for which a `table_rewrite` event has just been called[2][4].

### Usage

Event triggers can be used for various purposes, such as auditing schema changes, enforcing naming conventions, and automating database management tasks.

For example, you can create an event trigger to log all DDL commands:

```sql
CREATE TABLE ddl_history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    ddl_date TIMESTAMPTZ,
    ddl_tag TEXT,
    object_name TEXT
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_ddl()
RETURNS event_trigger AS $$
DECLARE
    r RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR r IN SELECT * FROM pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands()
    LOOP
        INSERT INTO ddl_history (ddl_date, ddl_tag, object_name)
        VALUES (statement_timestamp(), tg_tag, r.object_identity);
    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE EVENT TRIGGER log_ddl_info
ON ddl_command_end
EXECUTE FUNCTION log_ddl();
```

You can also create an event trigger to handle dropped objects:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_dropped_objects()
RETURNS event_trigger AS $$
DECLARE
    obj RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR obj IN SELECT * FROM pg_event_trigger_dropped_objects()
    LOOP
        RAISE NOTICE '% dropped object: % %.% %',
                     tg_tag,
                     obj.object_type,
                     obj.schema_name,
                     obj.object_name,
                     obj.object_identity;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE EVENT TRIGGER log_dropped_objects_info
ON sql_drop
EXECUTE FUNCTION log_dropped_objects();
```
