## Logical Operators in SQL

### Overview

SQL provides three logical operators: `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`. These operators are used to combine conditions in a query to filter data.

### Truth Tables

The following truth tables illustrate the behavior of these operators in a three-valued logic system, which includes `TRUE`, `FALSE`, and `NULL` (representing "unknown").

#### AND Operator

| a     | b     | a AND b |
| ----- | ----- | ------- |
| TRUE  | TRUE  | TRUE    |
| TRUE  | FALSE | FALSE   |
| TRUE  | NULL  | NULL    |
| FALSE | FALSE | FALSE   |
| FALSE | NULL  | FALSE   |
| NULL  | NULL  | NULL    |

#### OR Operator

| a     | b     | a OR b |
| ----- | ----- | ------ |
| TRUE  | TRUE  | TRUE   |
| TRUE  | FALSE | TRUE   |
| TRUE  | NULL  | TRUE   |
| FALSE | FALSE | FALSE  |
| FALSE | NULL  | NULL   |
| NULL  | NULL  | NULL   |

#### NOT Operator

| a     | NOT a |
| ----- | ----- |
| TRUE  | FALSE |
| FALSE | TRUE  |
| NULL  | NULL  |

### Commutativity

The `AND` and `OR` operators are commutative, meaning that the order of the operands does not affect the result. However, the order of evaluation of subexpressions is not guaranteed (see Section 4.2.14 for more information).

### Usage

#### Example 1: Filtering Data with AND

To find all employees who are over 30 years old and have a salary greater than $50,000:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE age > 30 AND salary > 50000;
```

#### Example 2: Filtering Data with OR

To find all customers who live in either New York or California:

```sql
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE state = 'NY' OR state = 'CA';
```

#### Example 3: Using NOT to Exclude Data

To find all products that are not discontinued:

```sql
SELECT * FROM products
WHERE NOT discontinued;
```

#### Example 4: Handling NULL Values

To find all orders that have a total value greater than $100, including those with unknown totals:

```sql
SELECT * FROM orders
WHERE total > 100 OR total IS NULL;
```

Note that in the last example, using `OR total IS NULL` ensures that orders with unknown totals are included in the result set.
