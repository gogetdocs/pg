## Error Handling in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL provides several parameters and mechanisms for handling errors and ensuring database reliability. Here are some key parameters and their usage:

### 1. `exit_on_error` (boolean)

- **Description**: If set to `on`, any error will terminate the current session. By default, it is set to `off`, so only FATAL errors will terminate the session.
- **Usage**: This parameter is useful in environments where any error should lead to immediate termination for safety or consistency reasons.

**Example**:
To set `exit_on_error` to `on` in the `postgresql.conf` file:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET exit_on_error = on;
```

Then, restart the PostgreSQL server for the changes to take effect.

### 2. `restart_after_crash` (boolean)

- **Description**: When set to `on`, which is the default, PostgreSQL will automatically reinitialize after a backend crash. This maximizes database availability but may need to be disabled in certain scenarios, such as when PostgreSQL is managed by clusterware.
- **Usage**: This parameter ensures that the database server attempts to recover automatically after a crash, which is crucial for high availability.

**Example**:
To set `restart_after_crash` to `off` in the `postgresql.conf` file:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET restart_after_crash = off;
```

Then, restart the PostgreSQL server for the changes to take effect.

### 3. `data_sync_retry` (boolean)

- **Description**: When set to `off`, which is the default, PostgreSQL will raise a PANIC-level error on failure to flush modified data files to the file system, causing the database server to crash. Setting it to `on` allows PostgreSQL to report an error but continue running, retrying the data flushing operation in a later checkpoint.
- **Usage**: This parameter is critical in environments where data integrity is paramount, and the operating system's handling of buffered data in case of write-back failure is well understood.

**Example**:
To set `data_sync_retry` to `on` in the `postgresql.conf` file:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET data_sync_retry = on;
```

Then, restart the PostgreSQL server for the changes to take effect.

### 4. `recovery_init_sync_method` (enum)

- **Description**: This parameter determines how PostgreSQL synchronizes files before crash recovery. The default is `fsync`, which recursively opens and synchronizes all files in the data directory. On Linux, `syncfs` can be used instead, which synchronizes whole file systems and may be faster.
- **Usage**: This parameter is essential for ensuring that all WAL and data files are durably stored on disk before replaying changes, especially in scenarios involving crash recovery.

**Example**:
To set `recovery_init_sync_method` to `syncfs` in the `postgresql.conf` file on a Linux system:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET recovery_init_sync_method = 'syncfs';
```

Then, restart the PostgreSQL server for the changes to take effect.

### Additional Error Handling Mechanisms

#### `RAISE` Statement

The `RAISE` statement is used in PL/pgSQL to report messages and raise errors. It allows specifying the error severity level, message format, and additional information such as error details and hints.

**Example**:
To raise an exception with a custom message and hint:

```sql
RAISE EXCEPTION 'Nonexistent ID --> %', user_id USING HINT = 'Please check your user ID';
```

#### `ASSERT` Statement

The `ASSERT` statement is a shorthand for inserting debugging checks into PL/pgSQL functions. It raises an `ASSERT_FAILURE` exception if the specified condition is false or null.

**Example**:
To assert that a condition is true:

```sql
ASSERT my_condition, 'Assertion failed';
```
