# **PostgreSQL Replication Configuration**

### Sending Servers

These parameters control the behavior of sending servers in PostgreSQL replication.

#### `max_wal_senders`

Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections from standby servers or streaming base backup clients.

- Default: 10
- Can only be set at server start
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_wal_senders = 20;
```

#### `max_replication_slots`

Specifies the maximum number of replication slots that the server can support.

- Default: 10
- Can only be set at server start
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_replication_slots = 20;
```

#### `wal_keep_size`

Specifies the minimum size of past log file segments kept in the `pg_wal` directory.

- Default: 0 (no extra segments kept)
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_keep_size = '1GB';
```

#### `max_slot_wal_keep_size`

Specifies the maximum size of WAL files that replication slots are allowed to retain in the `pg_wal` directory at checkpoint time.

- Default: -1 (unlimited)
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_slot_wal_keep_size = '1GB';
```

#### `wal_sender_timeout`

Terminate replication connections that are inactive for longer than this amount of time.

- Default: 60 seconds
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_sender_timeout = 30000;  -- 30 seconds
```

#### `track_commit_timestamp`

Record commit time of transactions.

- Default: off
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET track_commit_timestamp = on;
```

### Primary Server

These parameters control the behavior of the primary server in PostgreSQL replication.

#### `synchronous_standby_names`

Specifies a list of standby servers that can support synchronous replication.

- Default: empty list (synchronous replication disabled)
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET synchronous_standby_names = 'FIRST 2 (s1, s2, s3)';
```

#### `vacuum_defer_cleanup_age`

Specifies the number of transactions by which VACUUM and HOT updates will defer cleanup of dead row versions.

- Default: 0
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET vacuum_defer_cleanup_age = 1000;
```

### Standby Servers

These parameters control the behavior of standby servers in PostgreSQL replication.

#### `primary_conninfo`

Specifies a connection string to be used for the standby server to connect with a sending server.

- Default: empty string
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET primary_conninfo = 'host=primary_server port=5432 user=replication_user password=replication_password';
```

#### `primary_slot_name`

Optionally specifies an existing replication slot to be used when connecting to the sending server via streaming replication.

- Default: empty string
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET primary_slot_name = 'my_replication_slot';
```

#### `promote_trigger_file`

Specifies a trigger file whose presence ends recovery in the standby.

- Default: empty string
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET promote_trigger_file = '/path/to/trigger/file';
```

#### `hot_standby`

Specifies whether or not you can connect and run queries during recovery.

- Default: on
- Can only be set at server start
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET hot_standby = off;
```

#### `max_standby_archive_delay`

Determines how long the standby server should wait before canceling standby queries that conflict with about-to-be-applied WAL entries.

- Default: 30 seconds
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_standby_archive_delay = 60000;  -- 1 minute
```

#### `max_standby_streaming_delay`

Determines how long the standby server should wait before canceling standby queries that conflict with about-to-be-applied WAL entries.

- Default: 30 seconds
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_standby_streaming_delay = 60000;  -- 1 minute
```

#### `wal_receiver_create_temp_slot`

Specifies whether the WAL receiver process should create a temporary replication slot on the remote instance when no permanent replication slot to use has been configured.

- Default: off
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_receiver_create_temp_slot = on;
```

#### `wal_receiver_status_interval`

Specifies the minimum frequency for the WAL receiver process on the standby to send information about replication progress to the primary or upstream standby.

- Default: 10 seconds
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_receiver_status_interval = 5;  -- 5 seconds
```

#### `hot_standby_feedback`

Specifies whether or not a hot standby will send feedback to the primary or upstream standby about queries currently executing on the standby.

- Default: off
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET hot_standby_feedback = on;
```

#### `wal_receiver_timeout`

Terminate replication connections that are inactive for longer than this amount of time.

- Default: 60 seconds
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_receiver_timeout = 30000;  -- 30 seconds
```

#### `wal_retrieve_retry_interval`

Specifies how long the standby server should wait when WAL data is not available from any sources before trying again to retrieve WAL data.

- Default: 5 seconds
- Can only be set in `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line
- Example:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_retrieve_retry_interval = 10000;  -- 10 seconds
```

#### `recovery_min_apply_delay`
