## PostgreSQL Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) Configuration

### Overview

PostgreSQL's Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) mechanism is crucial for ensuring database consistency and recoverability. This documentation covers the various WAL configuration parameters, their implications, and real-world usage examples.

### WAL Settings

#### `wal_level`

Determines how much information is written to the WAL. Possible values are `minimal`, `replica`, and `logical`.

- **`minimal`**: Logs only the information required to recover from a crash or immediate shutdown. This level generates the least WAL volume but does not support point-in-time recovery or streaming replication.
- **`replica`**: Writes enough data to support WAL archiving and replication, including running read-only queries on a standby server. This is the default value.
- **`logical`**: Includes all information logged at the `replica` level, plus additional information needed to support logical decoding.

**Example: Setting `wal_level` to `replica`**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = 'replica';
```

#### `fsync`

If `on`, the PostgreSQL server will ensure that updates are physically written to disk by issuing `fsync()` system calls.

- **`on`**: Ensures database consistency after an operating system or hardware crash.
- **`off`**: Can result in unrecoverable data corruption in the event of a power failure or system crash.

**Example: Setting `fsync` to `on`**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET fsync = on;
```

#### `synchronous_commit`

Specifies how much WAL processing must complete before the database server returns a “success” indication to the client.

- **`remote_apply`**: Waits for replies from the current synchronous standby(s) indicating they have received and applied the commit record.
- **`on`**: Waits for replies from the current synchronous standby(s) indicating they have received and flushed the commit record to durable storage.
- **`remote_write`**: Waits for replies from the current synchronous standby(s) indicating they have received the commit record and written it to their file systems.
- **`local`**: Waits for local flush to disk.
- **`off`**: Does not wait for any WAL flush.

**Example: Setting `synchronous_commit` to `on`**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET synchronous_commit = 'on';
```

#### `wal_sync_method`

Method used for forcing WAL updates out to disk.

- **`open_datasync`**: Writes WAL files with `open()` option `O_DSYNC`.
- **`fdatasync`**: Calls `fdatasync()` at each commit.
- **`fsync`**: Calls `fsync()` at each commit.
- **`fsync_writethrough`**: Calls `fsync()` at each commit, forcing write-through of any disk write cache.
- **`open_sync`**: Writes WAL files with `open()` option `O_SYNC`.

**Example: Setting `wal_sync_method` to `fsync`**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_sync_method = 'fsync';
```

#### `full_page_writes`

When `on`, the PostgreSQL server writes the entire content of each disk page to WAL during the first modification of that page after a checkpoint.

- **`on`**: Ensures that pages can be correctly restored after a crash.
- **`off`**: Speeds normal operation but might lead to unrecoverable data corruption after a system failure.

**Example: Setting `full_page_writes` to `on`**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET full_page_writes = on;
```

#### `wal_log_hints`

When `on`, the PostgreSQL server writes the entire content of each disk page to WAL during the first modification of that page after a checkpoint, even for non-critical modifications of hint bits.

- **`on`**: Useful for testing the impact of enabling data checksums.

**Example: Setting `wal_log_hints` to `on`**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_log_hints = on;
```

#### `wal_compression`

Enables compression of WAL using the specified compression method.

- **`pglz`**: PostgreSQL's built-in compression method.
- **`lz4`**: LZ4 compression method (if compiled with `--with-lz4`).
- **`zstd`**: Zstandard compression method (if compiled with `--with-zstd`).

**Example: Setting `wal_compression` to `pglz`**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_compression = 'pglz';
```

#### `wal_init_zero`

If `on`, new WAL files are filled with zeroes.

- **`on`**: Ensures space is allocated before writing WAL records.

**Example: Setting `wal_init_zero` to `on`**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_init_zero = on;
```

#### `wal_recycle`

If `on`, WAL files are recycled by renaming them.

- **`on`**: Avoids the need to create new WAL files.

**Example: Setting `wal_recycle` to `on`**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_recycle = on;
```

#### `wal_buffers`

The amount of shared memory used for WAL data that has not yet been written to disk.

- **Default**: 1/32nd of `shared_buffers`, but not less than 64kB nor more than the size of one WAL segment.

**Example: Setting `wal_buffers` to 16MB**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_buffers = '16MB';
```

#### `wal_writer_delay`

Specifies how often the WAL writer flushes WAL, in time terms.

- **Default**: 200 milliseconds.

**Example: Setting `wal_writer_delay` to 100 milliseconds**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_writer_delay = '100ms';
```

#### `wal_writer_flush_after`

Specifies how often the WAL writer flushes WAL, in volume terms.

- **Default**: 1MB.

**Example: Setting `wal_writer_flush_after` to 512kB**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_writer_flush_after = '512kB';
```

#### `wal_skip_threshold`

Determines how to persist new data when `wal_level` is `minimal`.

- **Default**: 2MB.

**Example: Setting `wal_skip_threshold` to 1MB**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_skip_threshold = '1MB';
```

#### `commit_delay`

Adds a time delay before a WAL flush is initiated.

- **Default**: 0 (no delay).

**Example: Setting `commit_delay` to 10 microseconds**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET commit_delay = '10us';
```

#### `commit_siblings`

Minimum number of concurrent open transactions to require before performing the `commit_delay` delay.

- **Default**: 5 transactions.

**Example: Setting `commit_siblings` to 10**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET commit_siblings = 10;
```

### Checkpoint Settings

#### `checkpoint_timeout`

Maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints.

- **Default**: 5 minutes.

**Example: Setting `checkpoint_timeout` to 10 minutes**

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET checkpoint_timeout = '10min';
```
