## PostgreSQL Set Operations: UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT

PostgreSQL provides powerful set operations to combine the results of two queries. These operations include UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT, which can be used to perform various data manipulations. This documentation explains each operation with examples and complete SQL code.

### 1. UNION

The UNION operation combines the results of two queries into a single result set. It removes duplicate rows unless the `ALL` keyword is used.

**Example: Combining Two Tables with UNION**

```sql
-- Create example tables
CREATE TABLE table1 (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE table2 (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);

-- Insert data into tables
INSERT INTO table1 (name) VALUES ('Alice'), ('Bob');
INSERT INTO table2 (name) VALUES ('Chris'), ('Alice');

-- Use UNION to combine results
SELECT name FROM table1
UNION
SELECT name FROM table2;
```

**Result:**

| name  |
| ----- |
| Alice |
| Bob   |
| Chris |

### 2. INTERSECT

The INTERSECT operation returns all rows that are common to both queries.

**Example: Finding Common Names with INTERSECT**

```sql
-- Use INTERSECT to find common names
SELECT name FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT name FROM table2;
```

**Result:**

| name  |
| ----- |
| Alice |

### 3. EXCEPT

The EXCEPT operation returns all rows that are in the first query but not in the second query.

**Example: Finding Names in table1 but not in table2 with EXCEPT**

```sql
-- Use EXCEPT to find names in table1 but not in table2
SELECT name FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT name FROM table2;
```

**Result:**

| name |
| ---- |
| Bob  |

### Important Notes

- **Data Type Compatibility**: For UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT operations, the two queries must be "union compatible," meaning they must return the same number of columns and the corresponding columns must have compatible data types[2].
- **Type Resolution**: When a SELECT is part of a UNION, INTERSECT, or EXCEPT construct, or when it appears within INSERT ... SELECT, the type of an unspecified-type literal can be taken from the other UNION arm or from the destination column[1].
- **Prior to PostgreSQL 10**: Unspecified-type literals in a SELECT output list were left as type unknown, which had negative consequences. This rule has been changed in PostgreSQL 10 and later versions[1].

### Usage

These set operations are crucial in various data analysis and manipulation scenarios. For example, you might use UNION to combine data from different sources, INTERSECT to find common data points, and EXCEPT to identify unique data points.

### Complete SQL Code

```sql
-- Create example tables
CREATE TABLE table1 (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);
CREATE TABLE table2 (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT);

-- Insert data into tables
INSERT INTO table1 (name) VALUES ('Alice'), ('Bob');
INSERT INTO table2 (name) VALUES ('Chris'), ('Alice');

-- Use UNION to combine results
SELECT name FROM table1
UNION
SELECT name FROM table2;

-- Use INTERSECT to find common names
SELECT name FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT name FROM table2;

-- Use EXCEPT to find names in table1 but not in table2
SELECT name FROM table1
EXCEPT
SELECT name FROM table2;
```

### Execution

Running the above SQL code will demonstrate the usage of UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT operations in PostgreSQL. The results will show how these operations can be used to combine and manipulate data from different tables.
