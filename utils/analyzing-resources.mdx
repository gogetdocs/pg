Yes, it's possible to analyze resource usage and identify bottlenecks in PostgreSQL at a granular level for optimizing queries and overall system performance. PostgreSQL provides several tools and methods that allow you to monitor queries and identify where inefficiencies or bottlenecks are occurring. Below are the key areas you can monitor and optimize:

### 1. **Identifying Slow Queries**

PostgreSQL has built-in tools to track and log queries that take a long time to execute:

- **`pg_stat_statements`**: A PostgreSQL extension that tracks execution statistics for all SQL queries. It provides metrics like total execution time, calls, average time per call, etc. You can enable it to gather query-level performance data.
  - To enable it, add this to `postgresql.conf`:
    ```bash
    shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
    ```
  - Then create the extension:
    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
    ```
  - After enabling, you can query it like this:
    ```sql
    SELECT query, calls, total_time, rows, mean_time, max_time
    FROM pg_stat_statements
    ORDER BY total_time DESC;
    ```

### 2. **Monitoring System Resources (CPU, Memory, Disk)**

PostgreSQL exposes metrics that show the impact of queries on system resources such as CPU and memory:

- **`EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)`**: Shows how a query is being executed and provides granular information, including the number of disk page reads, cache hits, and the CPU time spent in each part of the query execution.

  - Use it as follows:
    ```sql
    EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE condition;
    ```
  - This will show:
    - Time spent in each node (e.g., sequential scan, index scan, joins).
    - I/O statistics (cache hits, disk reads).

- **OS Monitoring**: You can monitor overall system resource usage using tools like `htop`, `iotop`, or `vmstat` at the OS level. These tools can help pinpoint if there’s high CPU usage, memory swapping, or disk I/O that might indicate a bottleneck.

### 3. **Concurrency Bottlenecks**

High contention for system resources can lead to bottlenecks:

- **Lock Contention**: Check if your queries are being blocked due to locking issues.
  - Use `pg_stat_activity` and `pg_locks`:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';
    SELECT * FROM pg_locks WHERE granted = false;
    ```
  - This will show which queries are waiting on locks and why they are being blocked.

### 4. **I/O Bottlenecks**

Disk I/O can be a major bottleneck, especially with large datasets:

- **Check Disk Usage**: Use `pg_stat_bgwriter` to monitor the background writer process, which handles I/O operations.

  - Example query:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pg_stat_bgwriter;
    ```

- **Indexes**: Ensure that the right indexes are in place to reduce disk I/O.
  - You can use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to check whether your query is using indexes effectively or performing sequential scans unnecessarily.

### 5. **Buffer Cache and Memory**

PostgreSQL uses a shared buffer cache to store data in memory, reducing disk I/O:

- **`pg_buffercache` Extension**: Helps in understanding buffer cache usage. It shows which tables and indexes are currently loaded in the cache.

  - Install the extension:
    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_buffercache;
    ```
  - Query buffer cache:
    ```sql
    SELECT relname, count(*) AS buffers, isdirty
    FROM pg_buffercache
    JOIN pg_class ON pg_buffercache.relfilenode = pg_class.relfilenode
    GROUP BY relname, isdirty;
    ```

- **Memory Usage**: Ensure the right amount of memory is allocated in PostgreSQL by tuning parameters like `shared_buffers` (memory for the buffer cache) and `work_mem` (memory allocated for operations like sorting and joining).

### 6. **Parallel Query Execution**

For CPU-bound tasks, you can enable **parallel query execution**. If a query is CPU-heavy, enabling parallelism can speed it up by spreading the workload across multiple CPU cores.

- Check if parallelism is enabled:
  ```sql
  SHOW max_parallel_workers_per_gather;
  ```
- Tune these parameters:
  - `max_parallel_workers_per_gather`
  - `parallel_tuple_cost`
  - `parallel_setup_cost`

### 7. **Autovacuum and Bloat**

Autovacuum keeps tables healthy by removing dead tuples. However, inefficient vacuuming can lead to bloat, making queries slower:

- **Monitor Autovacuum**:
  ```sql
  SELECT relname, last_vacuum, last_autovacuum
  FROM pg_stat_user_tables;
  ```
- Use the `pg_stat_all_tables` view to ensure that tables are being vacuumed regularly. For large tables, manual vacuuming may be required.

### 8. **Tuning Query Execution Parameters**

PostgreSQL has several settings that can be tuned to optimize query execution based on your hardware:

- **`work_mem`**: Memory allocated to sort or join operations. Setting this too low can result in slow disk-based sorting.
- **`maintenance_work_mem`**: Controls memory for maintenance operations like `VACUUM` and `CREATE INDEX`.

### 9. **Logs and Monitoring Tools**

PostgreSQL logs and third-party tools can help monitor query performance and system health:

- **Enable Logging for Slow Queries**:
  ```bash
  log_min_duration_statement = 1000  # Logs queries taking more than 1 second
  ```
- **pgAdmin, Grafana, and pg_stat_monitor**: Tools that provide a GUI to visualize performance, track long-running queries, and resource utilization trends over time.

### Steps to Optimize Queries

1. **Identify slow queries** using `pg_stat_statements`.
2. **Analyze query plans** with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE)` to see where time is being spent.
3. **Check indexes** and ensure queries use them efficiently. Add or modify indexes where needed.
4. **Monitor locks and contention** to identify waiting processes.
5. **Tweak memory settings** (e.g., `work_mem`, `shared_buffers`) based on system resources.
6. **Review parallelism settings** to leverage multi-core CPUs.
7. **Vacuum and prevent bloat** using `VACUUM` and adjusting autovacuum settings.

By combining these techniques, you can identify specific bottlenecks (CPU, disk, memory, locking) at a query level and make appropriate optimizations to PostgreSQL and your queries.

is that it?

---

That was an overview of the primary tools and techniques you can use to identify and address performance bottlenecks in PostgreSQL. However, there are **additional, advanced** areas to explore that can provide even deeper insight into performance optimization. Let’s dive into more granular methods and techniques for optimizing PostgreSQL, covering the lesser-known but highly effective strategies:

### 10. **Query Execution Profile and Wait Events**

PostgreSQL provides detailed wait event statistics that can help identify bottlenecks when a query is stuck or waiting for a resource. This is useful for diagnosing I/O contention, lock issues, and other stalls.

- **Wait Events**: Available in the `pg_stat_activity` view, these show where a query is spending time while waiting for resources.
  ```sql
  SELECT pid, state, query, wait_event_type, wait_event
  FROM pg_stat_activity
  WHERE state = 'active';
  ```
  Wait event types include:
  - **LWLock**: Lightweight lock waits, typically caused by contention in the buffer manager.
  - **IO**: Waiting for disk I/O, which can suggest slow storage or missing indexes.
  - **Lock**: Waiting for table or row-level locks.

This can help you understand whether your query is CPU-bound, I/O-bound, or stuck on lock acquisition.

### 11. **Analyze Table and Index Bloat (pg_stat_user_tables)**

**Bloat** refers to the wasted space in tables and indexes, leading to slower query performance due to unnecessary disk I/O.

- **pg_stat_user_tables**: Gives information about table sizes, dead tuples, and vacuum stats, helping identify bloated tables.
  ```sql
  SELECT relname AS table, n_live_tup AS live, n_dead_tup AS dead
  FROM pg_stat_user_tables
  ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;
  ```
- **pg_repack**: A popular extension that allows you to efficiently remove bloat from tables and indexes **without locking the table** during the operation.
  ```bash
  pg_repack -d your_database -t your_table
  ```

### 12. **Tracking Disk Usage of Individual Queries**

While `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)` shows you how much of the query execution involved buffer reads, you may need a more granular view of disk usage:

- **pg_stat_io**: A PostgreSQL extension (starting from version 15) that tracks disk I/O usage by individual queries. It helps you identify whether your query is I/O-heavy and whether you can reduce disk reads by better caching or indexing strategies.
  - Example of using `pg_stat_io`:
    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM pg_stat_io WHERE query_id = 'your_query_id';
    ```

### 13. **Partitioning for Large Tables**

Partitioning large tables can drastically improve query performance by splitting data into smaller, more manageable chunks. This can reduce the amount of data scanned during a query, improving both I/O and memory usage.

- **Declarative Partitioning**: PostgreSQL supports range and list partitioning natively.

  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE orders (
      order_id INT,
      customer_id INT,
      order_date DATE
  ) PARTITION BY RANGE (order_date);

  CREATE TABLE orders_2024 PARTITION OF orders
  FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');
  ```

- **Optimizing Partition Pruning**: Ensure that partition pruning is working effectively by indexing the partition key and using the key in WHERE clauses.
  ```sql
  EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date = '2024-03-01';
  ```

### 14. **Connection Pooling to Handle High Concurrency**

PostgreSQL can handle many concurrent connections, but each connection uses memory and resources. For high-concurrency applications, **connection pooling** is critical for reducing the overhead of opening and closing connections.

- **PgBouncer**: A lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL that reduces the overhead of managing many connections.
  - Run PgBouncer between your application and PostgreSQL to handle connection limits more efficiently.
  - Configure it for transaction-level pooling:
    ```ini
    pool_mode = transaction
    max_client_conn = 1000
    default_pool_size = 100
    ```
- **pg_stat_activity**: Monitor the number of active connections:
  ```sql
  SELECT datname, numbackends
  FROM pg_stat_database;
  ```

### 15. **Optimizing JOINs and Complex Queries**

JOINs and complex queries can introduce hidden inefficiencies, particularly when multiple large tables are involved. Some tips for optimizing complex queries:

- **Ensure Proper Indexing on JOIN Keys**: Indexes on both sides of the join condition can drastically reduce execution time.
  ```sql
  EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) SELECT * FROM orders JOIN customers ON orders.customer_id = customers.customer_id;
  ```
- **Avoid Cartesian Products**: Ensure that your JOIN conditions are tight and avoid scenarios where you inadvertently introduce cartesian products, which can slow down queries significantly.
- **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Be cautious with CTEs in PostgreSQL versions prior to 12, as they are treated as optimization fences. In PostgreSQL 12+, this has been changed to allow the planner to optimize CTEs.
  - For older versions:
    ```sql
    WITH cte AS (SELECT * FROM large_table)
    SELECT * FROM cte WHERE some_condition;
    ```
    This might force PostgreSQL to materialize the CTE, leading to slower performance.

### 16. **Customizing Autovacuum for Specific Tables**

The default autovacuum settings may not always work well for all tables, especially those that experience frequent writes. You can fine-tune autovacuum per table:

- **Custom Autovacuum Settings**:
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE my_large_table
  SET (autovacuum_vacuum_threshold = 5000, autovacuum_vacuum_scale_factor = 0.01);
  ```
  This will trigger autovacuum more frequently for the specified table, preventing excessive bloat.

### 17. **PostgreSQL Parallel Query Optimization**

- Ensure your queries benefit from parallel execution by checking parallelism in the `EXPLAIN` output:
  ```sql
  EXPLAIN (ANALYZE) SELECT * FROM large_table WHERE condition;
  ```
  You should see "Parallel" steps in the query plan if parallel execution is utilized.
- Increase `max_parallel_workers_per_gather` to allow more parallel workers for large queries:
  ```sql
  SET max_parallel_workers_per_gather = 4;
  ```

### 18. **Using Materialized Views for Expensive Queries**

If your queries are expensive and often involve the same data, materialized views can provide a performance boost by precomputing and storing the results of a complex query:

- **Creating a Materialized View**:
  ```sql
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW my_view AS
  SELECT customer_id, SUM(order_total) AS total_spent
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY customer_id;
  ```
- **Refreshing Materialized Views**:
  ```sql
  REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW my_view;
  ```

### 19. **Using pg_stat_statements for Query Fingerprinting**

You can use **pg_stat_statements** not only to track individual slow queries but to **fingerprint and aggregate similar queries** (e.g., parameterized queries) to identify patterns of slow execution across similar queries.

- Query the most expensive queries over time:
  ```sql
  SELECT query, total_time, calls, mean_time
  FROM pg_stat_statements
  ORDER BY total_time DESC
  LIMIT 10;
  ```

### 20. **Reducing Network Latency and Optimizing Data Transfers**

Sometimes, the performance issue is not with PostgreSQL itself but with how the data is being transferred between the database and your application. Optimizations here can include:

- **Batch Queries**: Instead of issuing multiple small queries, batch them together in one larger query to reduce round-trip latency.
- **Binary Format**: Use PostgreSQL's binary format for large result sets or binary data, which is more compact and faster to transfer than text.

---

### Advanced Monitoring Tools for Real-Time Diagnostics

In addition to PostgreSQL’s built-in features, there are several third-party tools that can give you deep insight into your PostgreSQL performance:

- **pg_stat_monitor**: An advanced extension for PostgreSQL that provides real-time query performance statistics, including wait times, CPU usage, and I/O stats.
- **pgDash / PMM (Percona Monitoring and Management)**: GUI-based monitoring tools that offer extensive visualization of query performance, CPU and memory usage, and disk I/O.
- **pgTune**: A tool that suggests optimized configuration settings based on your system's hardware and workload.

---

By combining these more advanced techniques, you can gain a **comprehensive and detailed understanding** of PostgreSQL’s performance characteristics. This will help in tuning queries, avoiding resource bottlenecks, and ensuring your system is fully optimized for high performance.

how to see resources like memory, cpu, network all those things consumed by a query along with timing as well

---

To monitor resource usage like **memory**, **CPU**, **network**, and **I/O** at the query level in PostgreSQL along with **timing information**, we can leverage a combination of PostgreSQL's built-in tools, extensions, and external monitoring approaches. PostgreSQL doesn't directly expose all system-level metrics (like CPU or network usage for a query), but there are effective ways to approximate or track this information.

Here's a step-by-step guide for tracking these resources:

### 1. **Track Query Execution Time with EXPLAIN ANALYZE**

**`EXPLAIN (ANALYZE)`** is the first tool to check query execution times, CPU usage patterns, and buffer hits. It gives you detailed timing for each step of the query execution, but it doesn’t provide direct memory, CPU, or network usage.

Example:

```sql
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS, VERBOSE) SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE condition;
```

This will output:

- **Execution Time**: For each operation (e.g., sequential scan, index scan, etc.).
- **Buffers**: The number of pages read from disk (I/O) and memory.
- **Timing**: Total and per-step execution time.

### 2. **Monitor Memory Usage with `work_mem`**

While **memory usage** per query isn’t directly tracked in PostgreSQL, you can approximate it using the `work_mem` setting, which defines the memory allocated for sorting, joining, and other operations.

- **Adjust `work_mem`**: PostgreSQL allocates memory per query. If your query involves large joins, sorting, or aggregation, increasing `work_mem` can improve performance.

Example of how to track queries that use memory:

```sql
SET work_mem = '64MB';  -- Adjust this as needed
```

To optimize memory usage, monitor your query performance before and after adjusting `work_mem` with `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE)`.

### 3. **pg_stat_statements: Track High-Level CPU, Memory, and I/O**

The **`pg_stat_statements`** extension provides high-level query performance statistics, including the time spent executing queries, number of executions, and I/O statistics. Although it doesn’t show CPU or memory directly, you can use it to track query execution patterns over time.

1. Enable `pg_stat_statements`:

   ```bash
   shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_stat_statements'
   ```

2. Create the extension:

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
   ```

3. Query the statistics:

   ```sql
   SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time, shared_blks_read, shared_blks_hit, temp_blks_read, temp_blks_written
   FROM pg_stat_statements
   ORDER BY total_time DESC;
   ```

This output will help you track:

- **Total time**: Time taken by the query.
- **Shared/Temp blocks**: Number of disk blocks read (I/O usage).
- **Cache hits**: Helps you see if queries are memory- or disk-bound.

### 4. **pg_stat_io for Disk I/O Usage (PostgreSQL 15 and Later)**

In PostgreSQL 15+, the **`pg_stat_io`** view provides more granular information about disk I/O usage by specific queries. You can use this to see how much disk I/O a query causes.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_io WHERE query_id = 'your_query_id';
```

This shows how much data was read from disk vs. memory, helping to identify I/O bottlenecks.

### 5. **OS-Level Monitoring: CPU, Memory, and Network Usage for Queries**

At the PostgreSQL level, there isn't a built-in feature that directly tracks **CPU**, **memory**, or **network usage** for specific queries. However, you can **correlate PostgreSQL process IDs (PIDs)** with system resource usage using operating system tools.

#### Step 1: Find the Process ID (PID) of the Query

Use `pg_stat_activity` to get the PID of the active query:

```sql
SELECT pid, usename, query, state, backend_start, query_start, wait_event_type, wait_event
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active';
```

#### Step 2: Track CPU and Memory Usage Using OS Tools

1. **Linux: `top` or `htop`**

   - Run `top` or `htop` and look for the PostgreSQL process with the corresponding PID.
   - This will show CPU and memory usage for that process, which corresponds to the query.

   Example:

   ```bash
   top -p <pid_of_postgres_process>
   ```

   - `RES`: Resident memory (RAM) used by the process.
   - `%CPU`: CPU usage by the process.
   - **Network activity** is generally hard to pinpoint per query at the system level unless your queries involve external data transfer or replication.

2. **Linux: `iotop` (For I/O Usage)**

   Use `iotop` to track disk I/O usage by the PostgreSQL process handling the query:

   ```bash
   sudo iotop -p <pid_of_postgres_process>
   ```

   This will show real-time I/O read and write operations for the specific PostgreSQL process.

#### Step 3: Combine with PostgreSQL Data

By combining `pg_stat_activity` with OS-level monitoring tools like `top` or `iotop`, you can get real-time resource consumption (CPU, memory, and disk I/O) for a query.

### 6. **pg_stat_kcache (Track Kernel-Level Stats, CPU, and I/O)**

To monitor **CPU**, **memory**, and I/O usage at a **kernel level** per query, you can use the `pg_stat_kcache` extension. It tracks system-level resource usage, like CPU time and read/write statistics.

1. Install the extension (requires `pg_stat_kcache`):

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_kcache;
   ```

2. Query the kernel cache statistics:

   ```sql
   SELECT pid, reads, writes, user_time, system_time
   FROM pg_stat_kcache
   JOIN pg_stat_activity ON pg_stat_kcache.pid = pg_stat_activity.pid;
   ```

   - **user_time**: Time spent in user space (CPU time).
   - **system_time**: Time spent in kernel space (I/O waits, CPU time).
   - **reads/writes**: I/O usage by the query.

This provides a clearer view of CPU time and I/O waits, making it a good tool for low-level system diagnostics.

### 7. **External Monitoring Tools: Complete Resource Tracking**

There are third-party tools and services that provide **real-time performance monitoring** and resource tracking (CPU, memory, network) across your PostgreSQL instance, including at the query level:

- **pg_stat_monitor**: This PostgreSQL extension is an advanced replacement for `pg_stat_statements` and provides more detailed statistics, including wait events, CPU usage, and I/O information.
  - Installation and usage:
    ```sql
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_monitor;
    SELECT query, total_exec_time, cpu_user_time, cpu_sys_time, io_read_bytes, io_write_bytes
    FROM pg_stat_monitor
    ORDER BY total_exec_time DESC;
    ```
- **PMM (Percona Monitoring and Management)**: PMM provides full-stack monitoring for PostgreSQL, showing detailed metrics like CPU, memory, I/O, and query performance in a unified dashboard.
- **pgDash, Datadog, and Zabbix**: These provide dashboards that aggregate resource usage data across queries, allowing you to track trends and outliers.

### 8. **PostgreSQL Wait Events for Resource Contention**

**Wait events** can indicate if a query is stuck waiting for CPU, I/O, or other system resources. Track these via `pg_stat_activity`:

```sql
SELECT pid, query, wait_event_type, wait_event
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE state = 'active';
```

- **CPU-bound**: Queries often spend time in the `CPU` event type.
- **I/O-bound**: Look for wait events related to `IO` or `BufferPin`.
- **Locks**: Queries may also be waiting for locks, shown under `Lock` wait events.

is there any monitoring optiong using queries for analyzing, if you dont have access to the vm, but only via the user name and pwd to the pg server only, how to capture such stats relating to each queries to fine tune them

---

If you only have access to PostgreSQL through a username and password (i.e., no access to the underlying virtual machine (VM) or operating system), you can still gather many performance-related statistics **directly from within PostgreSQL** using various system views and extensions. These allow you to capture statistics related to queries, including execution time, I/O usage, memory usage (indirectly), and even some CPU usage data.

Here’s how you can **capture query-related stats entirely from SQL**, and fine-tune your queries:

### 1. **pg_stat_statements: Capture Query Execution Stats**

The `pg_stat_statements` extension is the most commonly used extension to gather statistics about query execution across your PostgreSQL server.

#### Steps to Enable and Use `pg_stat_statements`:

1. **Check if pg_stat_statements is Enabled**: Run the following query to check if `pg_stat_statements` is enabled:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'pg_stat_statements';
   ```

2. **Create the Extension (if not already enabled)**: If you have the necessary permissions, you can enable the `pg_stat_statements` extension:

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
   ```

3. **Query Execution Statistics**: Once enabled, you can use it to analyze query performance:

   ```sql
   SELECT query, calls, total_time, mean_time, rows, shared_blks_read, shared_blks_hit, temp_blks_read, temp_blks_written
   FROM pg_stat_statements
   ORDER BY total_time DESC
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

   This view gives you key statistics:

   - **Query**: The SQL query text.
   - **Calls**: Number of times the query has been executed.
   - **Total time**: The cumulative time the query has taken.
   - **Mean time**: Average time taken per execution.
   - **Shared blocks read/hit**: I/O statistics, showing how many blocks were read from disk (read) vs. memory (hit).
   - **Temporary blocks read/written**: Indicates if temp files are used, which can signal memory issues.

4. **Track Expensive Queries**: To find the most time-consuming queries:

   ```sql
   SELECT query, total_time, mean_time, calls
   FROM pg_stat_statements
   ORDER BY total_time DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

5. **Find Queries with Most I/O**: To identify queries that perform the most disk I/O:

   ```sql
   SELECT query, shared_blks_read, shared_blks_hit, temp_blks_read, temp_blks_written
   FROM pg_stat_statements
   ORDER BY shared_blks_read DESC
   LIMIT 5;
   ```

   Queries with high `shared_blks_read` are likely reading from disk frequently, indicating a potential need for better indexing or caching.

### 2. **pg_stat_activity: Real-Time Query Monitoring**

The `pg_stat_activity` view provides real-time monitoring of currently running queries. You can use it to capture long-running queries or those waiting for resources.

1. **Find Active Queries**: To get a snapshot of currently active queries:

   ```sql
   SELECT pid, usename, state, query, backend_start, query_start, wait_event_type, wait_event
   FROM pg_stat_activity
   WHERE state = 'active';
   ```

   This will show:

   - **PID**: Process ID of the query.
   - **State**: Whether the query is active, idle, or waiting.
   - **Wait event**: If the query is waiting on a lock or other resource, you’ll see the reason.
   - **Backend_start / query_start**: Helps identify long-running queries.

2. **Track Long-Running Queries**: If you want to specifically monitor long-running queries:

   ```sql
   SELECT pid, usename, query, state, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (now() - query_start)) AS runtime_seconds
   FROM pg_stat_activity
   WHERE state = 'active'
   AND now() - query_start > INTERVAL '10 minutes';
   ```

   This can help identify queries that are potentially problematic due to excessive runtime.

### 3. **EXPLAIN (ANALYZE): Query Plan and Timing**

You can analyze the performance of individual queries using `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE)` to get detailed execution plans and timings.

1. **Analyze Query Execution**:

   ```sql
   EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) SELECT * FROM your_table WHERE condition;
   ```

   This provides:

   - **Execution plan**: Shows how PostgreSQL executes the query.
   - **Actual time per step**: Detailed timing for each step of the query (e.g., sequential scan, index scan).
   - **Buffers read/hit**: Tells you whether the query is reading from disk or memory, helping you understand I/O patterns.

2. **Check for Sequential Scans**: If you notice sequential scans on large tables, this might indicate a missing index. You can create appropriate indexes to improve performance.

   Example:

   ```sql
   CREATE INDEX ON your_table (your_column);
   ```

### 4. **pg_stat_io (PostgreSQL 15 and Later)**

In PostgreSQL 15+, the `pg_stat_io` view provides granular I/O information for each query, helping you track how much of the query is dependent on disk or memory operations.

1. **Check Query I/O Stats**:

   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM pg_stat_io WHERE query_id = 'your_query_id';
   ```

   This will give you a breakdown of disk reads vs. cache hits, helping you diagnose I/O-related performance bottlenecks.

### 5. **pg_stat_user_tables: Monitor Table-Level Stats**

The `pg_stat_user_tables` view provides information about table-specific performance statistics, such as read/write operations and bloat.

1. **Check Table I/O and Vacuum Stats**:

   ```sql
   SELECT relname AS table_name, seq_scan, seq_tup_read, idx_scan, idx_tup_fetch, n_tup_ins, n_tup_upd, n_tup_del, n_live_tup, n_dead_tup
   FROM pg_stat_user_tables
   ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;
   ```

   Key metrics:

   - **seq_scan**: Number of sequential scans (indicating possible missing indexes).
   - **idx_scan**: Number of index scans.
   - **n_dead_tup**: Number of dead tuples (indicating possible table bloat, suggesting a need for vacuuming).

### 6. **pg_stat_kcache: System-Level Stats (if Available)**

If the `pg_stat_kcache` extension is installed, it provides low-level system stats like CPU time, disk reads, and writes at a query level. This is very useful for tracking system resource consumption **per query**.

1. **Query pg_stat_kcache Stats**:

   ```sql
   SELECT pid, reads, writes, user_time, system_time
   FROM pg_stat_kcache
   JOIN pg_stat_activity ON pg_stat_kcache.pid = pg_stat_activity.pid;
   ```

   Metrics include:

   - **user_time/system_time**: CPU time spent in user mode and system (kernel) mode.
   - **reads/writes**: Disk I/O usage.

This extension helps you understand how much CPU and disk I/O is used by individual queries.

### 7. **pg_locks: Monitor Locking and Contention**

Lock contention can slow down queries. Use the `pg_locks` view to track queries that are waiting for locks or causing other queries to wait.

1. **Check for Locking Issues**:

   ```sql
   SELECT pid, locktype, relation::regclass AS table, mode, granted
   FROM pg_locks
   JOIN pg_stat_activity ON pg_locks.pid = pg_stat_activity.pid
   WHERE NOT granted;
   ```

   This will show which queries are waiting on locks, helping you identify and resolve locking contention issues.

### 8. **Autovacuum and Bloat Monitoring**

If tables are not regularly vacuumed, **bloat** can affect performance. You can monitor autovacuum behavior and track table bloat using `pg_stat_user_tables` and the `pg_stat_progress_vacuum` view.

1. **Check for Table Bloat**:

   ```sql
   SELECT relname AS table_name, n_dead_tup, n_live_tup
   FROM pg_stat_user_tables
   WHERE n_dead_tup > 10000
   ORDER BY n_dead_tup DESC;
   ```

2. **Monitor Active Vacuums**:

   ```sql
   SELECT pid, relname, phase, heap_blks_total, heap_blks_scanned
   FROM pg_stat_progress_vacuum;
   ```

   This shows the progress of any currently running `VACUUM` processes.

### 9. **pg_stat_progress_create_index: Index Creation Monitoring**

If you are creating large indexes, you can monitor their progress using the `pg_stat_progress_create_index` view.

1. **Check Index Creation Progress**:

   ```sql
   SELECT pid, relname, index_relname, tuples_total, tuples_done
   FROM pg_stat_progress_create_index;
   ```
