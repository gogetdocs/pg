## PostgreSQL Rules

### Overview

PostgreSQL rules are a powerful feature that allows you to manipulate and transform queries. Unlike triggers, which are executed for each row affected by a query, rules are applied at the query level, allowing for more complex and efficient transformations.

### Types of Rules

There are two main types of rules in PostgreSQL:

- **View Rules**: These are used to rewrite queries on views into queries on the underlying tables.
- **Update Rules**: These are used to manipulate queries on insert, update, and delete operations.

### Update Rules

Update rules are defined using the `CREATE RULE` command and can be used to perform various actions, such as inserting into a log table or updating a related table.

#### How Update Rules Work

Update rules are applied by the rule system when the result relation and the command type of a query tree match the object and event specified in the `CREATE RULE` command. The rule system creates a list of query trees, which can include zero, one, or multiple actions.

Here is an example of an update rule that logs changes to the `sl_avail` column in the `shoelace_data` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE shoelace_log (
    sl_name text,
    sl_avail integer,
    log_who text,
    log_when timestamp
);

CREATE RULE log_shoelace AS ON UPDATE TO shoelace_data
WHERE NEW.sl_avail <> OLD.sl_avail
DO INSERT INTO shoelace_log VALUES (
    NEW.sl_name,
    NEW.sl_avail,
    current_user,
    current_timestamp
);
```

This rule will insert a new log entry into the `shoelace_log` table whenever the `sl_avail` column is updated in the `shoelace_data` table.

#### Usage

Suppose we have a table `shoelace_data` that stores information about shoelaces, and we want to keep a log of all changes to the `sl_avail` column.

```sql
CREATE TABLE shoelace_data (
    sl_name text,
    sl_avail integer,
    sl_color text,
    sl_len numeric,
    sl_unit text
);

INSERT INTO shoelace_data VALUES ('sl1', 5, 'black', 80, 'cm');
INSERT INTO shoelace_data VALUES ('sl2', 6, 'black', 100, 'cm');

UPDATE shoelace_data SET sl_avail = 10 WHERE sl_name = 'sl1';

SELECT * FROM shoelace_log;
```

This will result in a new log entry being inserted into the `shoelace_log` table:

| sl_name | sl_avail | log_who | log_when         |
| ------- | -------- | ------- | ---------------- |
| sl1     | 10       | Al      | 2023-02-20 14:30 |

### Cooperation with Views

Rules can also be used to protect view relations from insert, update, and delete operations.

#### Usage

Suppose we have a view `shoelace` that is based on the `shoelace_data` table, and we want to prevent users from inserting, updating, or deleting rows in the view.

```sql
CREATE VIEW shoelace AS
SELECT * FROM shoelace_data;

CREATE RULE shoe_ins_protect AS ON INSERT TO shoelace
DO INSTEAD NOTHING;

CREATE RULE shoe_upd_protect AS ON UPDATE TO shoelace
DO INSTEAD NOTHING;

CREATE RULE shoe_del_protect AS ON DELETE TO shoelace
DO INSTEAD NOTHING;
```

This will prevent any insert, update, or delete operations on the `shoelace` view.

### Advanced Usage

Rules can also be used to perform more complex transformations, such as rewriting queries on views into queries on the underlying tables.

#### Usage

Suppose we have a view `shoelace` that is based on the `shoelace_data` table, and we want to allow users to insert, update, and delete rows in the view.

```sql
CREATE RULE shoelace_ins AS ON INSERT TO shoelace
DO INSTEAD
INSERT INTO shoelace_data VALUES (
    NEW.sl_name,
    NEW.sl_avail,
    NEW.sl_color,
    NEW.sl_len,
    NEW.sl_unit
);

CREATE RULE shoelace_upd AS ON UPDATE TO shoelace
DO INSTEAD
UPDATE shoelace_data
SET sl_name = NEW.sl_name,
    sl_avail = NEW.sl_avail,
    sl_color = NEW.sl_color,
    sl_len = NEW.sl_len,
    sl_unit = NEW.sl_unit
WHERE sl_name = OLD.sl_name;

CREATE RULE shoelace_del AS ON DELETE TO shoelace
DO INSTEAD
DELETE FROM shoelace_data
WHERE sl_name = OLD.sl_name;
```

This will allow users to insert, update, and delete rows in the `shoelace` view, and the rules will transform the queries into queries on the underlying `shoelace_data` table.
