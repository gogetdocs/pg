# **Multicolumn Indexes in PostgreSQL**

## **Introduction**

In PostgreSQL, an index can be defined on more than one column of a table. This is known as a multicolumn index. Multicolumn indexes can be used to improve the performance of queries that filter on multiple columns.

## **Creating a Multicolumn Index**

To create a multicolumn index, you can use the `CREATE INDEX` statement and specify multiple columns in the `ON` clause. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test2 (
  major int,
  minor int,
  name varchar
);

CREATE INDEX test2_mm_idx ON test2 (major, minor);
```

## **Using Multicolumn Indexes**

Multicolumn indexes can be used with query conditions that involve any subset of the index's columns. However, the index is most efficient when there are constraints on the leading (leftmost) columns.

### B-Tree Indexes

A multicolumn B-tree index can be used with query conditions that involve any subset of the index's columns. The exact rule is that equality constraints on leading columns, plus any inequality constraints on the first column that does not have an equality constraint, will be used to limit the portion of the index that is scanned.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test2 (
  major int,
  minor int,
  name varchar
);

CREATE INDEX test2_mm_idx ON test2 (major, minor);

SELECT name FROM test2 WHERE major = 5 AND minor >= 42 AND name < 'foo';
```

In this example, the index would have to be scanned from the first entry with `major = 5` and `minor = 42` up through the last entry with `major = 5`. Index entries with `name >= 'foo'` would be skipped, but they'd still have to be scanned through.

### GiST Indexes

A multicolumn GiST index can be used with query conditions that involve any subset of the index's columns. Conditions on additional columns restrict the entries returned by the index, but the condition on the first column is the most important one for determining how much of the index needs to be scanned.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test2 (
  major int,
  minor int,
  name varchar
);

CREATE INDEX test2_mm_idx ON test2 USING GIST (major, minor);

SELECT name FROM test2 WHERE major = 5 AND minor >= 42 AND name < 'foo';
```

In this example, the index would be relatively ineffective if the first column (`major`) has only a few distinct values, even if there are many distinct values in additional columns.

### GIN Indexes

A multicolumn GIN index can be used with query conditions that involve any subset of the index's columns. Unlike B-tree or GiST, index search effectiveness is the same regardless of which index column(s) the query conditions use.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test2 (
  major int,
  minor int,
  name varchar
);

CREATE INDEX test2_mm_idx ON test2 USING GIN (major, minor);

SELECT name FROM test2 WHERE major = 5 AND minor >= 42 AND name < 'foo';
```

In this example, the index would be effective regardless of which column(s) are used in the query conditions.

### BRIN Indexes

A multicolumn BRIN index can be used with query conditions that involve any subset of the index's columns. Like GIN and unlike B-tree or GiST, index search effectiveness is the same regardless of which index column(s) the query conditions use.

Example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test2 (
  major int,
  minor int,
  name varchar
);

CREATE INDEX test2_mm_idx ON test2 USING BRIN (major, minor);

SELECT name FROM test2 WHERE major = 5 AND minor >= 42 AND name < 'foo';
```

In this example, the index would be effective regardless of which column(s) are used in the query conditions.

## **Best Practices**

Multicolumn indexes should be used sparingly. In most situations, an index on a single column is sufficient and saves space and time. Indexes with more than three columns are unlikely to be helpful unless the usage of the table is extremely stylized.
