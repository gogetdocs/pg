## Indexes and Collations

### Overview

Indexes in PostgreSQL can support only one collation per index column. If multiple collations are required, multiple indexes must be created.

### Creating a Table with a Specific Collation

```sql
CREATE TABLE test1c (
    id integer,
    content varchar COLLATE "en_US.UTF-8"
);
```

In this example, the `content` column is created with the `en_US.UTF-8` collation.

### Creating an Index with a Specific Collation

```sql
CREATE INDEX test1c_content_index ON test1c (content);
```

This index will automatically use the collation of the underlying `content` column.

### Using the Index with a Query

```sql
SELECT * FROM test1c WHERE content > 'constant';
```

This query can use the `test1c_content_index` index because the comparison will default to the collation of the `content` column.

### Creating an Additional Index with a Different Collation

```sql
CREATE INDEX test1c_content_y_index ON test1c (content COLLATE "fr_FR.UTF-8");
```

This index supports the `fr_FR.UTF-8` collation and can be used for queries that require this collation.

### Using the Additional Index with a Query

```sql
SELECT * FROM test1c WHERE content > 'constant' COLLATE "fr_FR.UTF-8";
```

This query can use the `test1c_content_y_index` index because it specifies the `fr_FR.UTF-8` collation.

### Example

Suppose we have a table `books` with a column `title` that contains book titles in different languages. We want to create indexes to support queries with different collations.

```sql
CREATE TABLE books (
    id integer,
    title varchar COLLATE "en_US.UTF-8"
);

CREATE INDEX books_title_en_index ON books (title);
CREATE INDEX books_title_fr_index ON books (title COLLATE "fr_FR.UTF-8");
CREATE INDEX books_title_es_index ON books (title COLLATE "es_ES.UTF-8");
```

We can then use these indexes for queries with different collations:

```sql
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title > 'constant';  -- uses books_title_en_index
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title > 'constant' COLLATE "fr_FR.UTF-8";  -- uses books_title_fr_index
SELECT * FROM books WHERE title > 'constant' COLLATE "es_ES.UTF-8";  -- uses books_title_es_index
```

Note that creating multiple indexes can increase storage requirements and slow down write operations. Therefore, it's essential to carefully evaluate the need for multiple indexes and consider the trade-offs.
