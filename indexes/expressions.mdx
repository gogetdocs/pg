## Indexes on Expressions

### Overview

Indexes on expressions allow you to create an index on a column that is derived from one or more columns of the underlying table. This feature is useful for obtaining fast access to tables based on the results of computations.

### Example 1: Case-Insensitive Comparisons

Suppose we have a table `test1` with a column `col1` and we want to perform case-insensitive comparisons on this column.

```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE test1 (
    col1 VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO test1 (col1) VALUES ('Value'), ('value'), ('VALUE');

-- Create an index on the lower(col1) function
CREATE INDEX test1_lower_col1_idx ON test1 (lower(col1));

-- Query the table using the index
SELECT * FROM test1 WHERE lower(col1) = 'value';
```

In this example, the index `test1_lower_col1_idx` is created on the result of the `lower(col1)` function. This allows the query to use the index for fast access to the table.

### Example 2: Concatenating Columns

Suppose we have a table `people` with columns `first_name` and `last_name` and we want to perform queries on the concatenation of these columns.

```sql
-- Create a table
CREATE TABLE people (
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Insert some data
INSERT INTO people (first_name, last_name) VALUES ('John', 'Smith'), ('Jane', 'Doe');

-- Create an index on the concatenation of first_name and last_name
CREATE INDEX people_names ON people ((first_name || ' ' || last_name));

-- Query the table using the index
SELECT * FROM people WHERE (first_name || ' ' || last_name) = 'John Smith';
```

In this example, the index `people_names` is created on the concatenation of `first_name` and `last_name`. This allows the query to use the index for fast access to the table.

### Important Considerations

- Index expressions are relatively expensive to maintain, because the derived expression(s) must be computed for each row insertion and non-HOT update.
- The index expressions are not recomputed during an indexed search, since they are already stored in the index.
- Indexes on expressions are useful when retrieval speed is more important than insertion and update speed.

### Best Practices

- Use indexes on expressions when you need to perform queries on computed columns.
- Consider the trade-off between retrieval speed and insertion/update speed when deciding whether to use an index on an expression.
- Use parentheses around index expressions in the `CREATE INDEX` command, unless the expression is just a function call.
