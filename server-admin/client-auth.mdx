## Client Authentication in PostgreSQL

Client authentication in PostgreSQL is a critical process that determines whether a client application can connect to a database server with a specified database user name. This process involves verifying the identity of the client and ensuring that the client has the necessary privileges to access the requested database.

### 21.1. The pg_hba.conf File

The `pg_hba.conf` file is a configuration file that controls client authentication. It is traditionally stored in the database cluster's data directory and is read on start-up and when the main server process receives a SIGHUP signal[4][5].

#### Format of pg_hba.conf

The `pg_hba.conf` file consists of a set of records, one per line. Each record specifies a connection type, a client IP address range, a database name, a user name, and the authentication method to be used for connections matching these parameters[4][5].

```plaintext
# TYPE DATABASE USER ADDRESS METHOD
local all all trust
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5
host all all ::1/128 md5
```

### 21.2. User Name Maps

User name maps are used to map operating system user names to PostgreSQL database user names. This is useful when the operating system user names do not match the PostgreSQL database user names.

```sql
-- Create a user name map
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR PUBLIC SERVER myserver OPTIONS (user 'myuser', password 'mypassword');
```

### 21.3. Authentication Methods

PostgreSQL offers several authentication methods, including:

- **Trust Authentication**: Allows the connection unconditionally.
- **Password Authentication**: Requires the client to supply a password for authentication.
- **GSSAPI Authentication**: Uses GSSAPI to authenticate the user.
- **SSPI Authentication**: Uses SSPI to authenticate the user (only available on Windows).
- **Ident Authentication**: Obtains the operating system user name of the client by contacting the ident server on the client.
- **Peer Authentication**: Obtains the client's operating system user name from the operating system.
- **LDAP Authentication**: Authenticates using an LDAP server.
- **RADIUS Authentication**: Authenticates using a RADIUS server.
- **Certificate Authentication**: Authenticates using SSL client certificates.
- **PAM Authentication**: Authenticates using the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) service provided by the operating system.
- **BSD Authentication**: Authenticates using the BSD Authentication service provided by the operating system.

#### Examples of Authentication Methods

```plaintext
# Trust authentication
local all all trust

# Password authentication
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5

# GSSAPI authentication
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 gss

# Ident authentication
host all all 192.168.93.0/24 ident

# Peer authentication
local all all peer

# LDAP authentication
host all all 192.168.12.10/32 ldap

# RADIUS authentication
host all all 192.168.12.10/32 radius

# Certificate authentication
hostssl all all all cert

# PAM authentication
host all all 192.168.12.10/32 pam

# BSD authentication
host all all 192.168.12.10/32 bsd
```

### 21.4. Trust Authentication

Trust authentication allows the connection unconditionally. This method is not recommended for remote connections.

```plaintext
# Trust authentication
local all all trust
```

### 21.5. Password Authentication

Password authentication requires the client to supply a password for authentication.

```plaintext
# Password authentication
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5
```

### 21.6. GSSAPI Authentication

GSSAPI authentication uses GSSAPI to authenticate the user.

```plaintext
# GSSAPI authentication
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 gss
```

### 21.7. SSPI Authentication

SSPI authentication uses SSPI to authenticate the user (only available on Windows).

```plaintext
# SSPI authentication
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 sspi
```

### 21.8. Ident Authentication

Ident authentication obtains the operating system user name of the client by contacting the ident server on the client.

```plaintext
# Ident authentication
host all all 192.168.93.0/24 ident
```

### 21.9. Peer Authentication

Peer authentication obtains the client's operating system user name from the operating system.

```plaintext
# Peer authentication
local all all peer
```

### 21.10. LDAP Authentication

LDAP authentication authenticates using an LDAP server.

```plaintext
# LDAP authentication
host all all 192.168.12.10/32 ldap
```

### 21.11. RADIUS Authentication

RADIUS authentication authenticates using a RADIUS server.

```plaintext
# RADIUS authentication
host all all 192.168.12.10/32 radius
```

### 21.12. Certificate Authentication

Certificate authentication authenticates using SSL client certificates.

```plaintext
# Certificate authentication
hostssl all all all cert
```

### 21.13. PAM Authentication

PAM authentication authenticates using the Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) service provided by the operating system.

```plaintext
# PAM authentication
host all all 192.168.12.10/32 pam
```

### 21.14. BSD Authentication

BSD authentication authenticates using the BSD Authentication service provided by the operating system.

```plaintext
# BSD authentication
host all all 192.168.12.10/32 bsd
```

### 21.15. Authentication Problems

Common authentication problems include:

- **Connection refused**: The server is not listening on the specified port or the connection is blocked by a firewall.
- **Authentication failed**: The client supplied an incorrect password or the authentication method is not supported.
- **No pg_hba.conf entry**: The `pg_hba.conf` file does not contain an entry that matches the client's connection parameters.

To troubleshoot authentication problems, check the server logs for error messages and verify that the `pg_hba.conf` file is correctly configured.

### Usage

Here is an example of a `pg_hba.conf` file that allows local connections using trust authentication and remote connections using password authentication:

```plaintext
# TYPE DATABASE USER ADDRESS METHOD
local all all trust
host all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5
host all all ::1/128 md5
host all all 192.168.12.10/32 md5
```

This configuration allows local connections to any database using trust authentication and remote connections to any database using password authentication.

To connect to a database using password authentication, use the following command:

```sql
psql -h 192.168.12.10 -U myuser -d mydatabase
```

This command connects to the `mydatabase` database on the `192.168.12.
