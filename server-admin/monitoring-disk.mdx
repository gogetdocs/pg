### 1. Determining Disk Usage

PostgreSQL provides several methods to monitor disk usage, including SQL functions and command-line tools.

#### SQL Functions

- **Database Size**: Use `pg_database_size()` to find the size of a database.
  ```sql
  SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('your_database_name'));
  ```
- **Table Size**: Use `pg_relation_size()` to find the size of a table.
  ```sql
  SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('your_table_name'));
  ```
- **Index Size**: Use `pg_relation_size()` with the index name to find the size of an index.
  ```sql
  SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('your_index_name'));
  ```
- **Total Table Size Including Indexes**: Use `pg_total_relation_size()` to find the total size of a table including its indexes.
  ```sql
  SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('your_table_name'));
  ```

#### Command-Line Tools

- **Database Size**: Use `\l+` in `psql` to list all databases with their sizes.
- **Table Size**: Use `\d+` in `psql` to show all tables with their sizes.

### 2. Disk Full Failure

High disk utilization can lead to performance issues and potential failures. Regular monitoring is crucial to prevent disk full failures.

### 3. Usage Examples

#### Example 1: Monitoring Database Size

To monitor the size of a database named `learning`, use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('learning'));
```

This will return the size of the `learning` database in a human-readable format.

#### Example 2: Monitoring Table Size

To monitor the size of a table named `users`, use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('users'));
```

This will return the size of the `users` table in a human-readable format.

#### Example 3: Monitoring Index Size

To monitor the size of an index named `users_pkey`, use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size('users_pkey'));
```

This will return the size of the `users_pkey` index in a human-readable format.

#### Example 4: Monitoring Total Table Size Including Indexes

To monitor the total size of a table named `users` including its indexes, use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('users'));
```

This will return the total size of the `users` table including its indexes in a human-readable format.

#### Example 5: Listing All Tables with Their Sizes

To list all tables in a database with their sizes, use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT relname, pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(relname)) AS size
FROM pg_class
WHERE relkind = 'r'
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(relname) DESC;
```

This will return a list of all tables in the database with their sizes in a human-readable format, sorted by size in descending order.

#### Example 6: Finding the Largest Tables and Indexes

To find the largest tables and indexes in a database, use the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT relname, pg_size_pretty(pg_relation_size(relname)) AS size
FROM pg_class
ORDER BY pg_relation_size(relname) DESC;
```

This will return a list of all tables and indexes in the database with their sizes in a human-readable format, sorted by size in descending order.

### Additional Tools and Commands

- **`pg_stat_io`**: Provides insight into I/O statistics for each table and index in the database.
- **`iostat`**: Useful for viewing system-level I/O statistics and diagnosing bottlenecks outside of PostgreSQL.
- **`pg_statio_user_tables`**: Provides information on table I/O statistics, including blocks read and hit percentages.
- **`pg_stat_all_indexes`**: Provides information on index I/O statistics.
- **`pg_locks`** and **`pg_stat_activity`**: Useful for monitoring locks and deadlocks in the database.
