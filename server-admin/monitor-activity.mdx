## 1. Standard Unix Tools

Monitoring PostgreSQL often involves standard Unix tools like `ps`, `top`, `iostat`, and `vmstat`. These tools can provide insights into system performance, resource usage, and help identify bottlenecks.

### Usage

```bash
# View active processes related to PostgreSQL
ps aux | grep postgres

# Monitor real-time CPU and memory usage
top

# Check input/output statistics
iostat -x 5

# View virtual memory statistics
vmstat 5
```

---

## 2. The Cumulative Statistics System

PostgreSQL includes a robust cumulative statistics system that helps database administrators understand database activity and performance. It comprises several views that present various statistics.

### 2.1 Statistics Collection Configuration

To enable statistics collection, modify the PostgreSQL configuration file (`postgresql.conf`) to set:

```sql
# Enable statistics collection
track_counts = on
track_io_timing = on
log_statement = 'all'
```

### 2.2 Viewing Statistics

After configuring statistics collection, restart the PostgreSQL service to apply the changes. You can view collected statistics using the following queries:

```sql
-- View cumulative statistics
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_statements;
```

---
