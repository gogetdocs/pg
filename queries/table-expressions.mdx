## Table Expressions

Table expressions are used to compute tables in SQL queries. They contain a `FROM` clause that can be optionally followed by `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, and `HAVING` clauses. These clauses specify a pipeline of successive transformations performed on the table derived in the `FROM` clause.

### 7.2.1 The FROM Clause

The `FROM` clause derives a table from one or more other tables given in a comma-separated table reference list.

```sql
FROM table_reference [, table_reference [, ...]]
```

A table reference can be a table name (possibly schema-qualified), or a derived table such as a subquery, a `JOIN` construct, or complex combinations of these.

#### 7.2.1.1 Joined Tables

A joined table is a table derived from two other (real or derived) tables according to the rules of the particular join type. Inner, outer, and cross-joins are available.

```sql
T1 join_type T2 [ join_condition ]
```

- **Cross Join**: For every possible combination of rows from `T1` and `T2`, the joined table will contain a row consisting of all columns in `T1` followed by all columns in `T2`.

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 CROSS JOIN t2;
  ```

- **Inner Join**: For each row `R1` of `T1`, the joined table has a row for each row in `T2` that satisfies the join condition with `R1`.

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 INNER JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num;
  ```

- **Left Outer Join**: First, an inner join is performed. Then, for each row in `T1` that does not satisfy the join condition with any row in `T2`, a joined row is added with null values in columns of `T2`.

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num;
  ```

- **Right Outer Join**: Similar to left outer join but for rows in `T2` that do not satisfy the join condition with any row in `T1`.

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num;
  ```

- **Full Outer Join**: First, an inner join is performed. Then, for each row in `T1` that does not satisfy the join condition with any row in `T2`, a joined row is added with null values in columns of `T2`. Also, for each row of `T2` that does not satisfy the join condition with any row in `T1`, a joined row with null values in the columns of `T1` is added.

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM t1 FULL JOIN t2 ON t1.num = t2.num;
  ```

#### 7.2.1.2 Table and Column Aliases

A temporary name can be given to tables and complex table references to be used for references to the derived table in the rest of the query.

```sql
FROM table_reference AS alias
```

or

```sql
FROM table_reference alias
```

#### 7.2.1.3 Subqueries

Subqueries specifying a derived table must be enclosed in parentheses and must be assigned a table alias name.

```sql
FROM (SELECT * FROM table1) AS alias_name
```

#### 7.2.1.4 Table Functions

Table functions are functions that produce a set of rows, made up of either base data types (scalar types) or composite data types (table rows). They are used like a table, view, or subquery in the `FROM` clause of a query.

```sql
function_call [WITH ORDINALITY] [[AS] table_alias [(column_alias [, ... ])]]
```

#### 7.2.1.5 LATERAL Subqueries

Subqueries appearing in `FROM` can be preceded by the key word `LATERAL`. This allows them to reference columns provided by preceding `FROM` items.

```sql
SELECT * FROM foo, LATERAL (SELECT * FROM bar WHERE bar.id = foo.bar_id) ss;
```

### 7.2.2 The WHERE Clause

The `WHERE` clause is used to filter rows from the derived table.

```sql
WHERE search_condition
```

### 7.2.3 The GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses

The `GROUP BY` clause is used to group together those rows in a table that have the same values in all the columns listed.

```sql
SELECT select_list
FROM ...
[WHERE ...]
GROUP BY grouping_column_reference [, grouping_column_reference]...
```

The `HAVING` clause is used to filter grouped rows.

```sql
SELECT select_list
FROM ...
[WHERE ...]
GROUP BY ...
HAVING boolean_expression
```

### 7.2.4 GROUPING SETS, CUBE, and ROLLUP

More complex grouping operations can be performed using `GROUPING SETS`, `CUBE`, and `ROLLUP`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM items_sold
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS ((brand), (size), ());
```

- **ROLLUP**: Represents the given list of expressions and all prefixes of the list including the empty list.

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM items_sold
  GROUP BY ROLLUP (brand, size);
  ```

- **CUBE**: Represents the given list and all of its possible subsets (i.e., the power set).

  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM items_sold
  GROUP BY CUBE (brand, size);
  ```

### 7.2.5 Window Function Processing

Window functions are evaluated after any grouping, aggregation, and `HAVING` filtering is performed.

```sql
SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY brand ORDER BY sales DESC) AS row_num
FROM items_sold;
```

### Real World Usage Examples

#### Example 1: Joining Tables

Suppose we have two tables, `employees` and `departments`, and we want to find the department name for each employee.

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.name AS department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
```

#### Example 2: Using Table Aliases

Suppose we have a table `orders` and we want to find the total sales for each customer.

```sql
SELECT c.name, SUM(o.total) AS total_sales
FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.name;
```

#### Example 3: Using Subqueries

Suppose we have a table `products` and we want to find the products that have a price higher than the average price.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM products
WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products);
```

#### Example 4: Using Table Functions

Suppose we have a function `get_sales` that returns the sales for each product.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM get_sales() AS s
JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.id;
```
