**Combining Queries with UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT**

SQL provides three set operators to combine the results of two or more queries into a single result set: UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT. These operators are useful when you need to combine data from multiple tables or queries.

### UNION Operator

The UNION operator combines the results of two or more queries into a single result set, removing duplicates. The syntax is:

```sql
query1 UNION [ALL] query2
```

**Example:**

Suppose you have two tables, `Speakers` and `Authors`, with the following data:

| Name  | Role    |
| ----- | ------- |
| John  | Speaker |
| Jane  | Author  |
| Joe   | Speaker |
| Julia | Author  |

To get a list of all speakers and authors, you can use the UNION operator:

```sql
SELECT Name FROM Speakers
UNION
SELECT Name FROM Authors
```

Result:

| Name  |
| ----- |
| John  |
| Jane  |
| Joe   |
| Julia |

### INTERSECT Operator

The INTERSECT operator returns only the rows that are common to both queries. The syntax is:

```sql
query1 INTERSECT query2
```

**Example:**

Suppose you have two tables, `Dinner` and `Lunch`, with the following data:

| Item       | Meal   |
| ---------- | ------ |
| Apple      | Dinner |
| Aubergines | Lunch  |
| Salad      | Dinner |
| Steak      | Lunch  |
| Wine       | Dinner |
| Salad      | Lunch  |

To get a list of food items that are common to both meals, you can use the INTERSECT operator:

```sql
SELECT Item FROM Dinner
INTERSECT
SELECT Item FROM Lunch
```

Result:

| Item  |
| ----- |
| Salad |

### EXCEPT Operator

The EXCEPT operator returns only the rows that are in the first query but not in the second query. The syntax is:

```sql
query1 EXCEPT query2
```

**Example:**

Suppose you have two tables, `Speakers` and `Authors`, with the following data:

| Name  | Role    |
| ----- | ------- |
| John  | Speaker |
| Jane  | Author  |
| Joe   | Speaker |
| Julia | Author  |

To get a list of speakers who are not authors, you can use the EXCEPT operator:

```sql
SELECT Name FROM Speakers
EXCEPT
SELECT Name FROM Authors
```

Result:

| Name |
| ---- |
| John |
| Joe  |

### Combining Set Operations

You can combine set operations using parentheses to control the order of evaluation. For example:

```sql
query1 UNION query2 EXCEPT query3
```

is equivalent to:

```sql
(query1 UNION query2) EXCEPT query3
```

**Note:**

- The UNION and EXCEPT operators are left-associative, meaning that they are evaluated from left to right.
- The INTERSECT operator takes precedence over the UNION and EXCEPT operators.
- The number and order of columns must be the same in both queries, and the corresponding columns must have compatible data types[1][2][3].

### Usage

- Use UNION to combine data from multiple tables or queries, removing duplicates.
- Use INTERSECT to find common data between two queries.
- Use EXCEPT to find data that is in one query but not in another.

For example, you can use these operators to:

- Get a list of all customers who are also suppliers.
- Find the common products between two catalogs.
- Get a list of employees who are not managers.

By combining queries using UNION, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT, you can perform complex data analysis and manipulation tasks in SQL.
