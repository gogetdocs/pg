## Using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in SQL

### Overview

Common Table Expressions (CTEs) are temporary result sets that are defined within the execution of a single SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. They can be used to simplify complex queries, perform recursive operations, and improve readability.

### Basic Usage

CTEs are defined using the `WITH` keyword followed by the name of the CTE and a query that defines the CTE. The CTE can then be used in the main query like a regular table.

```sql
WITH regional_sales AS (
  SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY region
)
SELECT * FROM regional_sales;
```

### Recursive Queries

Recursive CTEs allow a query to reference its own output. This is useful for querying hierarchical or tree-structured data.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE included_parts(sub_part, part, quantity) AS (
  SELECT sub_part, part, quantity FROM parts WHERE part = 'our_product'
  UNION ALL
  SELECT p.sub_part, p.part, p.quantity * pr.quantity
  FROM included_parts pr, parts p
  WHERE p.part = pr.sub_part
)
SELECT sub_part, SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
FROM included_parts
GROUP BY sub_part;
```

### Search Order

When computing a tree traversal using a recursive query, you might want to order the results in either depth-first or breadth-first order.

**Depth-First Order**

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE search_tree(id, link, data, path) AS (
  SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data, ARRAY[t.id]
  FROM tree t
  UNION ALL
  SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data, path || t.id
  FROM tree t, search_tree st
  WHERE t.id = st.link
)
SELECT * FROM search_tree ORDER BY path;
```

**Breadth-First Order**

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE search_tree(id, link, data, depth) AS (
  SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data, 0
  FROM tree t
  UNION ALL
  SELECT t.id, t.link, t.data, depth + 1
  FROM tree t, search_tree st
  WHERE t.id = st.link
)
SELECT * FROM search_tree ORDER BY depth;
```

### Cycle Detection

When working with recursive queries, it's important to detect cycles to prevent infinite loops.

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE search_graph(id, link, data, depth, is_cycle, path) AS (
  SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, 0, false, ARRAY[g.id]
  FROM graph g
  UNION ALL
  SELECT g.id, g.link, g.data, sg.depth + 1, g.id = ANY(path), path || g.id
  FROM graph g, search_graph sg
  WHERE g.id = sg.link AND NOT is_cycle
)
SELECT * FROM search_graph;
```

### Materialization

CTEs can be materialized, which means that the query is evaluated only once and the results are stored in a temporary table.

```sql
WITH w AS (
  SELECT * FROM big_table
)
SELECT * FROM w WHERE key = 123;
```

**Non-Materialized CTE**

```sql
WITH w AS NOT MATERIALIZED (
  SELECT * FROM big_table
)
SELECT * FROM w AS w1 JOIN w AS w2 ON w1.key = w2.ref
WHERE w2.key = 123;
```

### Data-Modifying Statements in WITH

CTEs can be used with data-modifying statements like INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

```sql
WITH moved_rows AS (
  DELETE FROM products
  WHERE "date" >= '2010-10-01' AND "date" < '2010-11-01'
  RETURNING *
)
INSERT INTO products_log
SELECT * FROM moved_rows;
```

### Usage

**Example 1: Finding all direct and indirect sub-parts of a product**

```sql
WITH RECURSIVE included_parts(sub_part, part) AS (
  SELECT sub_part, part FROM parts WHERE part = 'our_product'
  UNION ALL
  SELECT p.sub_part, p.part
  FROM included_parts pr, parts p
  WHERE p.part = pr.sub_part
)
SELECT sub_part FROM included_parts;
```

**Example 2: Updating prices of products and logging changes**

```sql
WITH updated_prices AS (
  UPDATE products SET price = price * 1.05
  RETURNING *
)
INSERT INTO price_log
SELECT * FROM updated_prices;
```

**Example 3: Deleting rows from a table and logging deleted rows**

```sql
WITH deleted_rows AS (
  DELETE FROM products
  WHERE "date" >= '2010-10-01' AND "date" < '2010-11-01'
  RETURNING *
)
INSERT INTO deleted_log
SELECT * FROM deleted_rows;
```
