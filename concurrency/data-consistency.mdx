## Data Consistency Checks at the Application Level

### Overview

Data consistency checks are crucial for ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data in a database. In PostgreSQL, there are two primary methods for enforcing data consistency at the application level: using Serializable transactions and using explicit blocking locks.

### 13.4.1. Enforcing Consistency with Serializable Transactions

Serializable transactions provide the highest level of isolation and ensure that transactions are executed as if they were running in a serial order. This prevents concurrency anomalies such as dirty reads, non-repeatable reads, and phantom reads.

**Benefits:**

- Ensures data consistency without additional effort.
- Suitable for applications that require strict data integrity.
- Automatically retries transactions rolled back due to serialization failures when used with a framework.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Set default transaction isolation level to Serializable
ALTER SYSTEM SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'serializable';

-- Start a Serializable transaction
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;

-- Perform operations within the transaction
INSERT INTO accounts (id, balance) VALUES (1, 100);
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 50 WHERE id = 1;

-- Commit the transaction
COMMIT;
```

### 13.4.2. Enforcing Consistency with Explicit Blocking Locks

Explicit blocking locks can be used to ensure data consistency by locking specific rows or tables against concurrent updates.

**Locking Methods:**

- `SELECT FOR UPDATE`: Locks the returned rows against concurrent updates.
- `SELECT FOR SHARE`: Locks the returned rows against concurrent updates but allows shared locks.
- `LOCK TABLE`: Locks the entire table against concurrent updates.

**Example:**

```sql
-- Lock specific rows for update
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 50 WHERE id = 1;
COMMIT;

-- Lock the entire table for update
BEGIN;
LOCK TABLE accounts IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 50 WHERE id = 1;
COMMIT;
```

### Usage

#### Banking System

In a banking system, ensuring that account balances are accurate and consistent is critical. Using Serializable transactions or explicit blocking locks can prevent concurrency anomalies.

```sql
-- Using Serializable transactions
BEGIN TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 50 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 50 WHERE id = 2;
COMMIT;

-- Using explicit blocking locks
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 50 WHERE id = 1;
COMMIT;
```

#### Inventory Management

In an inventory management system, preventing the same item from being sold to multiple customers simultaneously is essential. Using explicit blocking locks can achieve this.

```sql
-- Lock the item row for update
BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM inventory WHERE item_id = 1 FOR UPDATE;
UPDATE inventory SET quantity = quantity - 1 WHERE item_id = 1;
COMMIT;
```
