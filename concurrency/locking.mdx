## PostgreSQL Locking Mechanisms

PostgreSQL provides various locking mechanisms to control concurrent access to data in tables. These mechanisms are crucial for ensuring data integrity and consistency in multi-user environments.

### Table-Level Locks

Table-level locks are used to control access to entire tables. PostgreSQL provides several table-level lock modes, each with its own set of conflicts and usage scenarios.

#### Table-Level Lock Modes

- **ACCESS SHARE (AccessShareLock)**

  - Conflicts with: ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock mode only.
  - Usage: Acquired by SELECT commands on referenced tables. Suitable for queries that only read tables without modifying them.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    LOCK TABLE accounts IN ACCESS SHARE MODE;
    SELECT * FROM accounts;
    COMMIT;
    ```

- **ROW SHARE (RowShareLock)**

  - Conflicts with: EXCLUSIVE and ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock modes.
  - Usage: Acquired by SELECT commands with FOR UPDATE, FOR NO KEY UPDATE, FOR SHARE, or FOR KEY SHARE options.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    LOCK TABLE accounts IN ROW SHARE MODE;
    SELECT * FROM accounts FOR UPDATE;
    COMMIT;
    ```

- **ROW EXCLUSIVE (RowExclusiveLock)**

  - Conflicts with: SHARE, SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE, EXCLUSIVE, and ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock modes.
  - Usage: Acquired by UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT, and MERGE commands on the target table.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    LOCK TABLE accounts IN ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 11111;
    COMMIT;
    ```

- **SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE (ShareUpdateExclusiveLock)**

  - Conflicts with: SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE, SHARE, SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE, EXCLUSIVE, and ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock modes.
  - Usage: Acquired by VACUUM (without FULL), ANALYZE, CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY, CREATE STATISTICS, COMMENT ON, REINDEX CONCURRENTLY, and certain ALTER INDEX and ALTER TABLE variants.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    LOCK TABLE accounts IN SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE MODE;
    VACUUM accounts;
    COMMIT;
    ```

- **SHARE (ShareLock)**

  - Conflicts with: ROW EXCLUSIVE, SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE, SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE, EXCLUSIVE, and ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock modes.
  - Usage: Acquired by CREATE INDEX (without CONCURRENTLY).
  - Example:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    LOCK TABLE accounts IN SHARE MODE;
    CREATE INDEX idx_acctnum ON accounts(acctnum);
    COMMIT;
    ```

- **SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE (ShareRowExclusiveLock)**

  - Conflicts with: ROW EXCLUSIVE, SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE, SHARE, SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE, EXCLUSIVE, and ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock modes.
  - Usage: Acquired by CREATE TRIGGER and some forms of ALTER TABLE.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    LOCK TABLE accounts IN SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE MODE;
    CREATE TRIGGER trg_update_balance BEFORE UPDATE ON accounts FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_balance();
    COMMIT;
    ```

- **EXCLUSIVE (ExclusiveLock)**

  - Conflicts with: ROW SHARE, ROW EXCLUSIVE, SHARE UPDATE EXCLUSIVE, SHARE, SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE, EXCLUSIVE, and ACCESS EXCLUSIVE lock modes.
  - Usage: Acquired by REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    LOCK TABLE accounts IN EXCLUSIVE MODE;
    REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY mv_accounts;
    COMMIT;
    ```

- **ACCESS EXCLUSIVE (AccessExclusiveLock)**
  - Conflicts with: All lock modes.
  - Usage: Acquired by DROP TABLE, TRUNCATE, REINDEX, CLUSTER, VACUUM FULL, and REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW (without CONCURRENTLY) commands.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    LOCK TABLE accounts IN ACCESS EXCLUSIVE MODE;
    TRUNCATE TABLE accounts;
    COMMIT;
    ```

### Row-Level Locks

Row-level locks are used to control access to specific rows within a table.

#### Row-Level Lock Modes

- **FOR UPDATE**

  - Usage: Locks rows as though for update, preventing other transactions from modifying or deleting these rows until the current transaction ends.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE acctnum = 11111 FOR UPDATE;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 11111;
    COMMIT;
    ```

- **FOR NO KEY UPDATE**

  - Usage: Similar to FOR UPDATE but allows SELECT FOR KEY SHARE commands to proceed.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE acctnum = 11111 FOR NO KEY UPDATE;
    UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 11111;
    COMMIT;
    ```

- **FOR SHARE**

  - Usage: Acquires a shared lock on each retrieved row, blocking other transactions from performing UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT FOR UPDATE, or SELECT FOR NO KEY UPDATE on these rows.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE acctnum = 11111 FOR SHARE;
    COMMIT;
    ```

- **FOR KEY SHARE**
  - Usage: Similar to FOR SHARE but allows SELECT FOR NO KEY UPDATE commands to proceed.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    BEGIN;
    SELECT * FROM accounts WHERE acctnum = 11111 FOR KEY SHARE;
    COMMIT;
    ```

### Page-Level Locks

Page-level locks are used to control read/write access to table pages in the shared buffer pool. These locks are released immediately after a row is fetched or updated.

### Deadlocks

Deadlocks occur when two or more transactions each hold locks that the other wants. PostgreSQL automatically detects and resolves deadlocks by aborting one of the transactions involved.

- **Example of a Deadlock:**

  ```sql
  -- Transaction 1
  BEGIN;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 11111;

  -- Transaction 2
  BEGIN;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance + 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 22222;
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 11111;

  -- Transaction 1 (continued)
  UPDATE accounts SET balance = balance - 100.00 WHERE acctnum = 22222;
  ```

### Advisory Locks

Advisory locks are application-defined locks that can be used to implement custom locking strategies.

- **Session-Level Advisory Locks:**

  - Usage: Acquired at session level and held until explicitly released or the session ends.
  - Example:
    ```sql
    SELECT pg_advisory_lock(12345);
    -- Perform operations
    SELECT pg_advisory_unlock(12345);
    ```

- **Transaction-Level Advisory Locks:**
  - Usage: Acquired at transaction level and automatically released at the
