## PostgreSQL Schemas: A Comprehensive Guide

### Overview

In PostgreSQL, a database cluster contains one or more named databases. Roles and certain object types are shared across the entire cluster. A client connection to the server can only access data in a single database, specified in the connection request. Within a database, there are one or more named schemas, which contain tables and other kinds of named objects, including data types, functions, and operators.

### Creating a Schema

To create a schema, use the `CREATE SCHEMA` command. For example:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA myschema;
```

You can also create a schema owned by another user:

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA schema_name AUTHORIZATION user_name;
```

### The Public Schema

Every new database contains a schema named "public". Objects created without specifying a schema name are automatically placed in the public schema. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products ( ... );
```

is equivalent to:

```sql
CREATE TABLE public.products ( ... );
```

### The Schema Search Path

Qualified names are tedious to write, and it's often best not to wire a particular schema name into applications. Therefore, tables are often referred to by unqualified names, which consist of just the table name. The system determines which table is meant by following a search path, which is a list of schemas to look in.

To show the current search path, use:

```sql
SHOW search_path;
```

In the default setup, this returns:

```sql
search_path
--------------

"$user", public
```

To add a new schema to the search path, use:

```sql
SET search_path TO myschema, public;
```

### Schemas and Privileges

By default, users cannot access any objects in schemas they do not own. To allow access, the owner of the schema must grant the `USAGE` privilege on the schema. For example:

```sql
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA myschema TO user_name;
```

To allow users to create objects in someone else's schema, grant the `CREATE` privilege on the schema:

```sql
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA myschema TO user_name;
```

### The System Catalog Schema

Each database contains a `pg_catalog` schema, which contains the system tables and all the built-in data types, functions, and operators. `pg_catalog` is always effectively part of the search path.

### Usage Patterns

#### Secure Schema Usage Pattern

1. **Constrain ordinary users to user-private schemas**:

   - Ensure no schemas have public `CREATE` privileges.
   - Create a schema with the same name as each user, for example:
     ```sql
     CREATE SCHEMA alice AUTHORIZATION alice;
     ```
   - This pattern is secure unless an untrusted user is the database owner or holds the `CREATEROLE` privilege.

2. **Remove the public schema from the default search path**:

   - Modify `postgresql.conf` or issue:
     ```sql
     ALTER ROLE ALL SET search_path = "$user";
     ```
   - Grant privileges to create in the public schema. Only qualified names will choose public schema objects.

3. **Keep the default search path and grant privileges to create in the public schema**:
   - This simulates the situation where schemas are not available at all, giving a smooth transition from the non-schema-aware world.
   - However, this is never a secure pattern and is acceptable only when the database has a single user or a few mutually-trusting users.

### Usage Examples

#### Example 1: Creating and Using a Schema

```sql
-- Create a new schema
CREATE SCHEMA myapp;

-- Create a table in the new schema
CREATE TABLE myapp.users (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Set the search path to include the new schema
SET search_path TO myapp, public;

-- Access the table without schema qualification
SELECT * FROM users;
```

#### Example 2: Granting Privileges

```sql
-- Create a new schema
CREATE SCHEMA myapp;

-- Grant usage privilege on the schema to a user
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA myapp TO myuser;

-- Grant create privilege on the schema to a user
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA myapp TO myuser;

-- Create a table in the schema as the granted user
SET ROLE myuser;
CREATE TABLE myapp.mytable (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    data VARCHAR(100)
);
```

#### Example 3: Using Qualified Names

```sql
-- Create a new schema
CREATE SCHEMA myapp;

-- Create a table in the public schema with the same name as in the new schema
CREATE TABLE public.mytable (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    data VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Create a table in the new schema
CREATE TABLE myapp.mytable (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    data VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Access the table in the new schema using a qualified name
SELECT * FROM myapp.mytable;
```

### Portability Considerations

- The SQL standard does not support the concept of objects in the same schema being owned by different users.
- Some implementations do not allow creating schemas with a different name than their owner.
- For maximum conformance to the standard, avoid using the public schema.
- If you need to work with systems that do not implement schemas or provide limited cross-database access, maximum portability is achieved by not using schemas at all.
