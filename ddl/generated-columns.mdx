## Generated Columns in PostgreSQL

### Overview

A generated column is a special column that is always computed from other columns. There are two kinds of generated columns: stored and virtual. PostgreSQL currently implements only stored generated columns.

### Creating a Generated Column

To create a generated column, use the `GENERATED ALWAYS AS` clause in `CREATE TABLE`. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE people (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    height_cm numeric,
    height_in numeric GENERATED ALWAYS AS (height_cm / 2.54) STORED
);
```

The `STORED` keyword must be specified to choose the stored kind of generated column.

### Key Differences Between Generated Columns and Column Defaults

- A column default is evaluated once when the row is first inserted if no other value was provided. A generated column is updated whenever the row changes and cannot be overridden.
- A column default may not refer to other columns of the table. A generation expression would normally do so.
- A column default can use volatile functions, for example `random()` or functions referring to the current time. This is not allowed for generated columns.

### Restrictions on Generated Columns

- The generation expression can only use immutable functions and cannot use subqueries or reference anything other than the current row in any way.
- A generation expression cannot reference another generated column.
- A generation expression cannot reference a system column, except `tableoid`.
- A generated column cannot have a column default or an identity definition.
- A generated column cannot be part of a partition key.

### Usage

Consider a table that stores product information, including the price in different currencies. You can use a generated column to automatically calculate the price in another currency based on the exchange rate.

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    price_eur numeric,
    price_usd numeric GENERATED ALWAYS AS (price_eur * 1.12) STORED
);

INSERT INTO products (name, price_eur) VALUES ('Product A', 100);

SELECT * FROM products;
```

This will insert a new product with a price of 100 EUR and automatically calculate the price in USD based on the exchange rate.

### Inheritance and Generated Columns

If a parent column is a generated column, a child column must also be a generated column using the same expression. In the definition of the child column, leave off the `GENERATED` clause, as it will be copied from the parent.

```sql
CREATE TABLE parent (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    height_cm numeric,
    height_in numeric GENERATED ALWAYS AS (height_cm / 2.54) STORED
);

CREATE TABLE child (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    height_cm numeric,
    height_in numeric
) INHERITS (parent);
```

### Additional Considerations

- Generated columns maintain access privileges separately from their underlying base columns. So, it is possible to arrange it so that a particular role can read from a generated column but not from the underlying base columns.
- Generated columns are, conceptually, updated after `BEFORE` triggers have run. Therefore, changes made to base columns in a `BEFORE` trigger will be reflected in generated columns. But conversely, it is not allowed to access generated columns in `BEFORE` triggers.
- Generated columns are skipped for logical replication and cannot be specified in a `CREATE PUBLICATION` column list.

### Foreign Tables and Generated Columns

Foreign tables can have generated columns. See `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE` for details.

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE foreign_products (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    price_eur numeric,
    price_usd numeric GENERATED ALWAYS AS (price_eur * 1.12) STORED
) SERVER myserver OPTIONS (table_name 'products');
```

This will create a foreign table with a generated column that calculates the price in USD based on the exchange rate.
