# **Foreign Data in PostgreSQL**

PostgreSQL provides a feature to access data that resides outside the database using regular SQL queries, known as foreign data. This is achieved through the use of foreign data wrappers, which are libraries that can communicate with external data sources.

## **Foreign Data Wrappers**

A foreign data wrapper is a library that hides the details of connecting to an external data source and obtaining data from it. There are several foreign data wrappers available as contrib modules, and others can be found as third-party products. If none of the existing foreign data wrappers suit your needs, you can write your own.

## **Creating a Foreign Server**

To access foreign data, you need to create a foreign server object, which defines how to connect to a particular external data source according to the set of options used by its supporting foreign data wrapper.

**Example: Creating a Foreign Server**

```sql
CREATE SERVER myserver FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw OPTIONS (
    host 'localhost',
    port 5432,
    dbname 'mydb'
);
```

In this example, we create a foreign server named `myserver` that uses the `postgres_fdw` foreign data wrapper to connect to a PostgreSQL database on `localhost` at port `5432` with the database name `mydb`.

## **Creating a Foreign Table**

Once you have created a foreign server, you need to create one or more foreign tables, which define the structure of the remote data.

**Example: Creating a Foreign Table**

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE mytable (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50),
    email VARCHAR(100)
)
SERVER myserver OPTIONS (
    schema_name 'public',
    table_name 'mytable'
);
```

In this example, we create a foreign table named `mytable` that uses the `myserver` foreign server to access a table named `mytable` in the `public` schema of the remote database.

## **Using a Foreign Table**

A foreign table can be used in queries just like a normal table, but it has no storage in the PostgreSQL server. Whenever it is used, PostgreSQL asks the foreign data wrapper to fetch data from the external source, or transmit data to the external source in the case of update commands.

**Example: Querying a Foreign Table**

```sql
SELECT * FROM mytable;
```

This query will fetch data from the remote table `mytable` using the `myserver` foreign server.

## **User Mapping**

Accessing remote data may require authenticating to the external data source. This information can be provided by a user mapping, which can provide additional data such as user names and passwords based on the current PostgreSQL role.

**Example: Creating a User Mapping**

```sql
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR CURRENT_USER SERVER myserver OPTIONS (
    user 'myuser',
    password 'mypassword'
);
```

In this example, we create a user mapping for the current PostgreSQL role that provides the user name `myuser` and password `mypassword` to use when connecting to the `myserver` foreign server.

## **Additional Information**

### Using Foreign Data in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL allows you to access data stored in external databases using foreign data wrappers. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to use these features:

#### 1. Creating a Foreign Data Wrapper

First, you need to create a foreign data wrapper. PostgreSQL comes with several built-in wrappers, such as `postgres_fdw` for accessing other PostgreSQL databases.

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION postgres_fdw;
```

#### 2. Creating a Foreign Server

Next, create a foreign server that defines how to connect to the external database.

```sql
CREATE SERVER foreign_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw OPTIONS (
    host '192.83.123.89',
    port '5432',
    dbname 'foreign_db'
);
```

#### 3. Creating a User Mapping

Create a user mapping to specify the remote user name and password to use when connecting to the foreign server.

```sql
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR local_user SERVER foreign_server OPTIONS (
    user 'foreign_user',
    password 'password'
);
```

#### 4. Creating a Foreign Table

Create a foreign table that represents a table in the external database. The columns of the foreign table must match the referenced remote table.

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE foreign_table (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    data text
)
SERVER foreign_server OPTIONS (
    schema_name 'some_schema',
    table_name 'some_table'
);
```

#### 5. Importing a Foreign Schema

Alternatively, you can import an entire schema from the external database using `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA`.

```sql
IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA foreign_schema FROM SERVER foreign_server INTO local_schema;
```

You can also limit the import to specific tables or exclude certain tables.

```sql
IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA foreign_schema LIMIT TO (table1, table2) FROM SERVER foreign_server INTO local_schema;

IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA foreign_schema EXCEPT (table3, table4) FROM SERVER foreign_server INTO local_schema;
```

### Additional Information

- **CREATE FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER**: Used to create a new foreign data wrapper[1].
- **CREATE SERVER**: Used to define a new foreign server[1].
- **CREATE USER MAPPING**: Used to create a new user mapping for a foreign server[1].
- **CREATE FOREIGN TABLE**: Used to create a new foreign table[1].
- **IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA**: Used to import table definitions from a foreign server[3][4].

### Example Usage

Here’s a complete example that demonstrates how to create a foreign server, user mapping, and foreign table, and then import a foreign schema.

```sql
-- Create the foreign data wrapper extension
CREATE EXTENSION postgres_fdw;

-- Create a foreign server
CREATE SERVER foreign_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw OPTIONS (
    host '192.83.123.89',
    port '5432',
    dbname 'foreign_db'
);

-- Create a user mapping
CREATE USER MAPPING FOR local_user SERVER foreign_server OPTIONS (
    user 'foreign_user',
    password 'password'
);

-- Create a foreign table
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE foreign_table (
    id integer NOT NULL,
    data text
)
SERVER foreign_server OPTIONS (
    schema_name 'some_schema',
    table_name 'some_table'
);

-- Import a foreign schema
IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA foreign_schema FROM SERVER foreign_server INTO local_schema;
```

### Note

- Ensure that the data types and other properties of the columns declared in `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE` match the actual remote table[1].
- Use `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA` to import table definitions from a foreign server, which can be more convenient than creating foreign tables manually[3][4].
