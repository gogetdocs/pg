## PostgreSQL Statistics for Query Planning

PostgreSQL uses statistics to estimate the number of rows retrieved by a query, which is crucial for choosing the best query plan. This section explains the types of statistics used by PostgreSQL and provides examples of their usage.

### 14.2.1. Single-Column Statistics

Single-column statistics are used to estimate the number of rows in a table and the distribution of values in each column.

#### Example: Viewing Single-Column Statistics

To view single-column statistics, you can query the `pg_class` and `pg_stats` system catalogs.

```sql
-- View table and index statistics
SELECT relname, relkind, reltuples, relpages
FROM pg_class
WHERE relname LIKE 'tenk1%';

-- View column statistics
SELECT attname, inherited, n_distinct,
       array_to_string(most_common_vals, E'\n') as most_common_vals
FROM pg_stats
WHERE tablename = 'road';
```

#### Note:

- `reltuples` and `relpages` in `pg_class` contain the total number of rows and disk blocks occupied by each table and index.
- `pg_stats` provides more detailed statistics, including the number of distinct values (`n_distinct`) and the most common values (`most_common_vals`) for each column.

### 14.2.2. Extended Statistics

Extended statistics capture correlations between multiple columns, which can significantly improve query planning for queries with conditions on multiple columns.

#### 14.2.2.1. Functional Dependencies

Functional dependencies track the relationship between columns where knowing the value of one column determines the value of another.

##### Example: Creating and Viewing Functional Dependency Statistics

```sql
-- Create a statistics object for functional dependencies
CREATE STATISTICS stts (dependencies) ON city, zip FROM zipcodes;

-- Analyze the table to collect statistics
ANALYZE zipcodes;

-- View the collected statistics
SELECT stxname, stxkeys, stxddependencies
FROM pg_statistic_ext join pg_statistic_ext_data on (oid = stxoid)
WHERE stxname = 'stts';
```

#### 14.2.2.2. Multivariate N-Distinct Counts

N-distinct statistics estimate the number of distinct values when combining multiple columns.

##### Example: Creating and Viewing N-Distinct Statistics

```sql
-- Create a statistics object for n-distinct counts
CREATE STATISTICS stts2 (ndistinct) ON city, state, zip FROM zipcodes;

-- Analyze the table to collect statistics
ANALYZE zipcodes;

-- View the collected statistics
SELECT stxkeys AS k, stxdndistinct AS nd
FROM pg_statistic_ext join pg_statistic_ext_data on (oid = stxoid)
WHERE stxname = 'stts2';
```

#### 14.2.2.3. Multivariate MCV Lists

MCV (Most Common Values) lists for combinations of columns improve estimates for queries with conditions on multiple columns.

##### Example: Creating and Viewing MCV Statistics

```sql
-- Create a statistics object for MCV lists
CREATE STATISTICS stts3 (mcv) ON city, state FROM zipcodes;

-- Analyze the table to collect statistics
ANALYZE zipcodes;

-- View the collected statistics
SELECT m.*
FROM pg_statistic_ext join pg_statistic_ext_data on (oid = stxoid),
     pg_mcv_list_items(stxdmcv) m
WHERE stxname = 'stts3';
```

### Important Considerations

- **Limitations of Functional Dependencies**: Currently, functional dependencies are only applied to simple equality conditions comparing columns to constant values and IN clauses with constant values. They are not used for other types of conditions.
- **Creating Statistics Objects**: It is advisable to create statistics objects only for column groups that are strongly correlated and actually used in queries, to avoid unnecessary overhead in ANALYZE and query planning.
- **Updating Statistics**: Statistics are updated by VACUUM, ANALYZE, and certain DDL commands. Regularly running ANALYZE can help keep statistics up-to-date and improve query planning.

### Usage

Consider a database table `zipcodes` with columns `city`, `state`, and `zip`. If queries frequently filter on combinations of these columns, creating extended statistics can improve query performance.

```sql
-- Create extended statistics
CREATE STATISTICS zip_stats (dependencies) ON city, zip FROM zipcodes;
CREATE STATISTICS zip_stats_ndistinct (ndistinct) ON city, state, zip FROM zipcodes;
CREATE STATISTICS zip_stats_mcv (mcv) ON city, state FROM zipcodes;

-- Analyze the table
ANALYZE zipcodes;

-- Example query that benefits from extended statistics
SELECT * FROM zipcodes WHERE city = 'San Francisco' AND zip = '94105';
```

By creating and maintaining appropriate statistics, PostgreSQL can make more accurate estimates and choose better query plans, leading to improved performance.
