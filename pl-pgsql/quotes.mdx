## Developing in PL/pgSQL

Developing in PL/pgSQL can be streamlined by using a combination of text editors and GUI database access tools. Here are some tips and best practices for developing in PL/pgSQL.

### Handling of Quotation Marks

When writing PL/pgSQL functions, it is essential to handle quotation marks correctly. The code of a PL/pgSQL function is specified in `CREATE FUNCTION` as a string literal. To avoid tedious and error-prone doubling of quotes, it is recommended to use dollar-quoted string literals.

**Example: Using Dollar-Quoted String Literals**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION testfunc(integer) RETURNS integer AS $PROC$
    -- function body
$PROC$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Within the dollar-quoted string literal, you can use single quotes for simple literal strings in SQL commands and `$$` to delimit fragments of SQL commands that you are assembling as strings.

**Example: Using Single Quotes and Dollar-Quoted Delimiters**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION testfunc(integer) RETURNS integer AS $PROC$
    a_output := 'Blah';
    SELECT * FROM users WHERE f_name='foobar';
$PROC$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Additional Compile-Time and Run-Time Checks

PL/pgSQL provides additional checks to aid in finding instances of simple but common problems before they cause harm. These checks can be enabled through the configuration variables `plpgsql.extra_warnings` and `plpgsql.extra_errors`.

**Example: Enabling Additional Checks**

```sql
SET plpgsql.extra_warnings TO 'all';
SET plpgsql.extra_errors TO 'all';
```

Available checks include:

- `shadowed_variables`: Checks if a declaration shadows a previously defined variable.
- `strict_multi_assignment`: Checks if the number of target variables and the number of source variables are different in a multi-assignment statement.
- `too_many_rows`: Checks if a query returns more than one row when an `INTO` clause is used.

**Example: Using Additional Checks**

```sql
SET plpgsql.extra_warnings TO 'shadowed_variables';

CREATE FUNCTION foo(f1 int) RETURNS int AS $$
DECLARE
    f1 int;
BEGIN
    RETURN f1;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

This will produce a warning:

```
WARNING:  variable "f1" shadows a previously defined variable
LINE 3: f1 int;
        ^
```

### Usage

Here is an example of a PL/pgSQL function that uses dollar-quoted string literals and additional checks:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.foo()
RETURNS void
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    x int;
    y int;
BEGIN
    SELECT 1 INTO x;
    SELECT 1, 2 INTO x, y;
END;
$$;

SELECT foo();
```

This will produce a warning:

```
WARNING:  number of source and target fields in assignment does not match
DETAIL:  strict_multi_assignment check of extra_warnings is active.
HINT:  Make sure the query returns the exact list of columns.
```

### Best Practices

- Use dollar-quoted string literals to avoid tedious and error-prone doubling of quotes.
- Enable additional checks through the configuration variables `plpgsql.extra_warnings` and `plpgsql.extra_errors`.
- Use GUI database access tools, such as pgAdmin, to facilitate development in PL/pgSQL.
- Test your functions in a separate development environment to avoid errors in production.
