## PL/pgSQL Structure and Usage

PL/pgSQL is a procedural language for PostgreSQL that allows you to write functions, triggers, and other database objects. Here's an overview of the structure and usage of PL/pgSQL.

### Creating a PL/pgSQL Function

To create a PL/pgSQL function, you use the `CREATE FUNCTION` command. The basic syntax is:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION function_name(data_type1, data_type2, ...) RETURNS data_type
AS 'function_body'
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

For example:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION add_two_numbers(integer, integer) RETURNS integer
AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN $1 + $2;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

In this example, `add_two_numbers` is the function name, `integer` is the data type of the two input parameters, and `integer` is the return data type. The function body is defined using dollar quoting (`$$`).

### Block Structure

PL/pgSQL is a block-structured language. A block is defined as:

```sql
[ <<label>> ]
[ DECLARE
    declarations ]
BEGIN
    statements
END [ label ];
```

Each declaration and statement within a block is terminated by a semicolon. A block that appears within another block must have a semicolon after `END`.

### Labels and Variables

A label is only needed if you want to identify the block for use in an `EXIT` statement or to qualify the names of variables declared in the block. Variables declared in a block mask any similarly-named variables of outer blocks for the duration of the block.

For example:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION somefunc() RETURNS integer AS $$
<< outerblock >>
DECLARE
    quantity integer := 30;
BEGIN
    RAISE NOTICE 'Quantity here is %', quantity;  -- Prints 30
    quantity := 50;
    --
    -- Create a subblock
    --
    DECLARE
        quantity integer := 80;
    BEGIN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Quantity here is %', quantity;  -- Prints 80
        RAISE NOTICE 'Outer quantity here is %', outerblock.quantity;  -- Prints 50
    END;

    RAISE NOTICE 'Quantity here is %', quantity;  -- Prints 50

    RETURN quantity;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

In this example, the `outerblock` label is used to qualify the `quantity` variable in the outer block.

### Subblocks

Subblocks can be used for logical grouping or to localize variables to a small group of statements. For example:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION somefunc() RETURNS integer AS $$
BEGIN
    --
    -- Create a subblock
    --
    DECLARE
        quantity integer := 80;
    BEGIN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Quantity here is %', quantity;  -- Prints 80
    END;

    RETURN 0;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Comments

Comments work the same way in PL/pgSQL code as in ordinary SQL. A double dash (`--`) starts a comment that extends to the end of the line. A `/*` starts a block comment that extends to the matching occurrence of `*/`. Block comments nest.

### Transaction Control

PL/pgSQL's `BEGIN`/`END` are only for grouping statements and do not start or end a transaction. To manage transactions in PL/pgSQL, use the `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK` commands. For example:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION somefunc() RETURNS integer AS $$
BEGIN
    BEGIN;  -- Start a transaction
    --
    -- Perform some operations
    --
    COMMIT;  -- Commit the transaction
    RETURN 0;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

Note that a block containing an `EXCEPTION` clause effectively forms a subtransaction that can be rolled back without affecting the outer transaction.

### Usage

Here's an example of a PL/pgSQL function that uses a subblock to localize variables:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION calculate_total(integer, integer) RETURNS integer AS $$
BEGIN
    --
    -- Create a subblock to localize variables
    --
    DECLARE
        subtotal integer := $1 * $2;
    BEGIN
        RAISE NOTICE 'Subtotal is %', subtotal;
        RETURN subtotal + 10;
    END;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

You can call this function using the `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT calculate_total(2, 3);
```

This will return the result of the calculation, which is 16.

Another example is a function that uses a loop to iterate over a table:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION sum_values() RETURNS integer AS $$
DECLARE
    total integer := 0;
    row record;
BEGIN
    FOR row IN SELECT * FROM mytable LOOP
        total := total + row.value;
    END LOOP;
    RETURN total;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

You can call this function using the `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT sum_values();
```

This will return the sum of the values in the `mytable` table.
