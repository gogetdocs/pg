## Transaction Management in PostgreSQL

Transaction management is a crucial aspect of database operations, allowing for the control of transactions in procedures and anonymous code blocks. In this section, we will explore the concepts and usage of transaction management in PostgreSQL.

### Ending Transactions

In PostgreSQL, transactions can be ended using the `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` commands. A new transaction is started automatically after a transaction is ended using these commands.

#### Example: Simple Transaction Management

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE transaction_test1()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 0..9 LOOP
        INSERT INTO test1 (a) VALUES (i);
        IF i % 2 = 0 THEN
            COMMIT;
        ELSE
            ROLLBACK;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$;

CALL transaction_test1();
```

In this example, a procedure `transaction_test1` is created, which inserts values into a table `test1` and commits or rolls back the transaction based on the value of `i`.

### Starting New Transactions with Same Characteristics

In cases where transactions are committed in a loop, it might be desirable to start new transactions automatically with the same characteristics as the previous one. The commands `COMMIT AND CHAIN` and `ROLLBACK AND CHAIN` accomplish this.

#### Example: Chaining Transactions

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE transaction_test3()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 0..9 LOOP
        INSERT INTO test1 (a) VALUES (i);
        IF i % 2 = 0 THEN
            COMMIT AND CHAIN;
        ELSE
            ROLLBACK AND CHAIN;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$;

CALL transaction_test3();
```

In this example, the `COMMIT AND CHAIN` and `ROLLBACK AND CHAIN` commands are used to start new transactions with the same characteristics as the previous one.

### Transaction Control in Nested Calls

Transaction control is only possible in `CALL` or `DO` invocations from the top level or nested `CALL` or `DO` invocations without any other intervening command.

#### Example: Nested Transaction Control

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE proc1()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    CALL proc2();
END;
$$;

CREATE PROCEDURE proc2()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO test1 (a) VALUES (1);
    COMMIT;
END;
$$;

CALL proc1();
```

In this example, the procedure `proc1` calls the procedure `proc2`, which performs a transaction control action.

### Special Considerations for Cursor Loops

Cursors are automatically closed at transaction commit. However, a cursor created as part of a loop is automatically converted to a holdable cursor by the first `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK`.

#### Example: Cursor Loop with Transaction Control

```sql
CREATE PROCEDURE transaction_test2()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    r RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR r IN SELECT * FROM test2 ORDER BY x LOOP
        INSERT INTO test1 (a) VALUES (r.x);
        COMMIT;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$;

CALL transaction_test2();
```

In this example, a cursor loop is used to insert values into a table `test1`, and the transaction is committed after each insertion.

### Restrictions on Transaction Control

Transaction commands are not allowed in cursor loops driven by commands that are not read-only (for example `UPDATE ... RETURNING`). Additionally, a transaction cannot be ended inside a block with exception handlers.

By understanding these concepts and usage examples, you can effectively manage transactions in your PostgreSQL database.
