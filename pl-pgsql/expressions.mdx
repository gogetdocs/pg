## Expressions in PL/pgSQL

### Overview

In PL/pgSQL, expressions are processed using the server's main SQL executor. This means that when you write a PL/pgSQL statement like `IF expression THEN ...`, it is evaluated by feeding a query like `SELECT expression` to the main SQL engine.

### How Expressions are Evaluated

When an expression is first used, a `PREPARE` command is essentially executed behind the scenes. For example, if you have declared two integer variables `x` and `y`, and you write `IF x < y THEN ...`, what happens is equivalent to:

```sql
PREPARE statement_name(integer, integer) AS SELECT $1 < $2;
```

This prepared statement is then `EXECUTEd` for each execution of the `IF` statement, with the current values of the PL/pgSQL variables supplied as parameter values.

### Usage

Here is an example of using an expression in a PL/pgSQL function:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_table_empty()
RETURNS boolean AS $$
DECLARE
    my_table_count integer;
BEGIN
    IF (SELECT count(*) FROM my_table) > 0 THEN
        RETURN FALSE;
    ELSE
        RETURN TRUE;
    END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

In this example, the expression `(SELECT count(*) FROM my_table)` is evaluated as a `SELECT` statement, and the result is used to determine whether the table is empty.

### Using Clauses in Expressions

Since an expression is converted to a `SELECT` command, it can contain the same clauses that an ordinary `SELECT` would, except that it cannot include a top-level `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, or `EXCEPT` clause. Here is an example of using a `FROM` clause in an expression:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION check_table_empty()
RETURNS boolean AS $$
DECLARE
    my_table_count integer;
BEGIN
    IF count(*) > 0 FROM my_table THEN
        RETURN FALSE;
    ELSE
        RETURN TRUE;
    END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

In this example, the expression `count(*) > 0 FROM my_table` is parsed as though it were `SELECT count(*) > 0 FROM my_table`.

### Important Notes

- The `SELECT` must produce a single column, and not more than one row. If it produces no rows, the result is taken as `NULL`.
- The details of how expressions are evaluated are not usually important to a PL/pgSQL user, but they can be useful to know when trying to diagnose a problem. More information can be found in Section 43.11.2.
