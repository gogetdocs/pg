## PostgreSQL Trigger Functions

Trigger functions in PostgreSQL are used to define actions that are automatically executed in response to certain events, such as data changes or database events. These functions are created using the PL/pgSQL language.

### Triggers on Data Changes

Triggers on data changes are used to execute actions before or after insert, update, or delete operations on a table.

#### Special Variables

When a PL/pgSQL function is called as a trigger, several special variables are created automatically in the top-level block:

- **NEW**: Data type RECORD; variable holding the new database row for INSERT/UPDATE operations in row-level triggers. This variable is null in statement-level triggers and for DELETE operations.
- **OLD**: Data type RECORD; variable holding the old database row for UPDATE/DELETE operations in row-level triggers. This variable is null in statement-level triggers and for INSERT operations.
- **TG_NAME**: Data type name; variable that contains the name of the trigger actually fired.
- **TG_WHEN**: Data type text; a string of BEFORE, AFTER, or INSTEAD OF, depending on the trigger's definition.
- **TG_LEVEL**: Data type text; a string of either ROW or STATEMENT depending on the trigger's definition.
- **TG_OP**: Data type text; a string of INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or TRUNCATE telling for which operation the trigger was fired.
- **TG_RELID**: Data type oid; the object ID of the table that caused the trigger invocation.
- **TG_RELNAME**: Data type name; the name of the table that caused the trigger invocation. This is now deprecated, and could disappear in a future release. Use **TG_TABLE_NAME** instead.
- **TG_TABLE_NAME**: Data type name; the name of the table that caused the trigger invocation.
- **TG_TABLE_SCHEMA**: Data type name; the name of the schema of the table that caused the trigger invocation.
- **TG_NARGS**: Data type integer; the number of arguments given to the trigger function in the CREATE TRIGGER statement.
- **TG_ARGV[]**: Data type array of text; the arguments from the CREATE TRIGGER statement. The index counts from 0. Invalid indexes (less than 0 or greater than or equal to tg_nargs) result in a null value.

#### Return Values

A trigger function must return either NULL or a record/row value having exactly the structure of the table the trigger was fired for.

- **Row-level triggers fired BEFORE** can return null to signal the trigger manager to skip the rest of the operation for this row. If a nonnull value is returned, then the operation proceeds with that row value. Returning a row value different from the original value of NEW alters the row that will be inserted or updated.
- **INSTEAD OF triggers** can return null to signal that they did not perform any updates, and that the rest of the operation for this row should be skipped. Otherwise, a nonnull value should be returned to signal that the trigger performed the requested operation.
- **Row-level triggers fired AFTER or statement-level triggers fired BEFORE or AFTER** always ignore the return value; it might as well be null. However, any of these types of triggers might still abort the entire operation by raising an error.

### Example 1: Auditing Trigger

This example trigger ensures that any insert, update, or delete of a row in the `emp` table is recorded (i.e., audited) in the `emp_audit` table. The current time and user name are stamped into the row, together with the type of operation performed on it.

```sql
CREATE TABLE emp (
    empname text NOT NULL,
    salary integer
);

CREATE TABLE emp_audit(
    operation char(1) NOT NULL,
    stamp timestamp NOT NULL,
    userid text NOT NULL,
    empname text NOT NULL,
    salary integer
);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION process_emp_audit() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $emp_audit$
BEGIN
    IF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
        INSERT INTO emp_audit SELECT 'D', now(), current_user, OLD.*;
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'UPDATE') THEN
        INSERT INTO emp_audit SELECT 'U', now(), current_user, NEW.*;
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
        INSERT INTO emp_audit SELECT 'I', now(), current_user, NEW.*;
    END IF;
    RETURN NULL; -- result is ignored since this is an AFTER trigger
END;
$emp_audit$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER emp_audit
AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON emp
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION process_emp_audit();
```

### Example 2: Maintaining a Summary Table

This example uses a trigger to maintain a summary table for a fact table in a data warehouse.

```sql
CREATE TABLE time_dimension (
    time_key integer NOT NULL,
    day_of_week integer NOT NULL,
    day_of_month integer NOT NULL,
    month integer NOT NULL,
    quarter integer NOT NULL,
    year integer NOT NULL
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX time_dimension_key ON time_dimension(time_key);

CREATE TABLE sales_fact (
    time_key integer NOT NULL,
    product_key integer NOT NULL,
    store_key integer NOT NULL,
    amount_sold numeric(12,2) NOT NULL,
    units_sold integer NOT NULL,
    amount_cost numeric(12,2) NOT NULL
);

CREATE INDEX sales_fact_time ON sales_fact(time_key);

CREATE TABLE sales_summary_bytime (
    time_key integer NOT NULL,
    amount_sold numeric(15,2) NOT NULL,
    units_sold numeric(12) NOT NULL,
    amount_cost numeric(15,2) NOT NULL
);

CREATE UNIQUE INDEX sales_summary_bytime_key ON sales_summary_bytime(time_key);

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION maint_sales_summary_bytime() RETURNS TRIGGER
AS $maint_sales_summary_bytime$
DECLARE
    delta_time_key integer;
    delta_amount_sold numeric(15,2);
    delta_units_sold numeric(12);
    delta_amount_cost numeric(15,2);
BEGIN
    IF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
        delta_time_key = OLD.time_key;
        delta_amount_sold = -1 * OLD.amount_sold;
        delta_units_sold = -1 * OLD.units_sold;
        delta_amount_cost = -1 * OLD.amount_cost;
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'UPDATE') THEN
        IF ( OLD.time_key != NEW.time_key) THEN
            RAISE EXCEPTION 'Update of time_key : % -> % not allowed', OLD.time_key, NEW.time_key;
        END IF;
        delta_time_key = OLD.time_key;
        delta_amount_sold = NEW.amount_sold - OLD.amount_sold;
        delta_units_sold = NEW.units_sold - OLD.units_sold;
        delta_amount_cost = NEW.amount_cost - OLD.amount_cost;
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
        delta_time_key = NEW.time_key;
        delta_amount_sold = NEW.amount_sold;
        delta_units_sold = NEW.units_sold;
        delta_amount_cost = NEW.amount_cost;
    END IF;

    LOOP
        UPDATE sales_summary_bytime
        SET amount_sold = amount_sold + delta_amount_sold,
            units_sold = units_sold + delta_units_sold,
            amount_cost = amount_cost + delta_amount_cost
        WHERE time_key = delta_time_key

```
