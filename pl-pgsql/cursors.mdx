## Using Cursors in PL/pgSQL

Cursors in PL/pgSQL are used to encapsulate a query and read its result a few rows at a time. This is particularly useful for handling large result sets and for returning references to cursors from functions.

### Declaring Cursor Variables

Cursor variables are declared using the `refcursor` data type. There are two ways to declare a cursor variable:

1. **Simple Declaration**: Declare a variable of type `refcursor`.
2. **Cursor Declaration Syntax**: Use the cursor declaration syntax to specify the query and optional parameters.

#### Examples

```sql
DECLARE
    curs1 refcursor;
    curs2 CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM tenk1;
    curs3 CURSOR (key integer) FOR SELECT * FROM tenk1 WHERE unique1 = key;
```

- **curs1** is an unbound cursor variable that can be used with any query.
- **curs2** is bound to a specific query.
- **curs3** is bound to a parameterized query.

### Opening Cursors

Before a cursor can be used to retrieve rows, it must be opened. There are three forms of the `OPEN` statement:

1. **OPEN FOR Query**: Opens an unbound cursor variable and gives it a query to execute.
2. **OPEN FOR EXECUTE**: Opens an unbound cursor variable and gives it a dynamic query to execute.
3. **Opening a Bound Cursor**: Opens a cursor variable whose query was bound to it when it was declared.

#### Examples

```sql
-- OPEN FOR Query
OPEN curs1 FOR SELECT * FROM foo WHERE key = mykey;

-- OPEN FOR EXECUTE
OPEN curs1 FOR EXECUTE format('SELECT * FROM %I WHERE col1 = $1', tabname) USING keyvalue;

-- Opening a Bound Cursor
OPEN curs2;
OPEN curs3(42);
OPEN curs3(key := 42);
```

### Using Cursors

Once a cursor has been opened, it can be manipulated with the following statements:

1. **FETCH**: Retrieves the next row from the cursor into a target variable.
2. **MOVE**: Repositions the cursor without retrieving any data.
3. **UPDATE/DELETE WHERE CURRENT OF**: Updates or deletes the row at the current cursor position.
4. **CLOSE**: Closes the portal underlying an open cursor.

#### Examples

```sql
-- FETCH
FETCH curs1 INTO rowvar;
FETCH curs2 INTO foo, bar, baz;
FETCH LAST FROM curs3 INTO x, y;
FETCH RELATIVE -2 FROM curs4 INTO x;

-- MOVE
MOVE curs1;
MOVE LAST FROM curs3;
MOVE RELATIVE -2 FROM curs4;
MOVE FORWARD 2 FROM curs4;

-- UPDATE/DELETE WHERE CURRENT OF
UPDATE foo SET dataval = myval WHERE CURRENT OF curs1;

-- CLOSE
CLOSE curs1;
```

### Returning Cursors

PL/pgSQL functions can return cursors to the caller. This is useful for returning multiple rows or columns, especially with very large result sets.

#### Examples

```sql
-- Specifying a Portal Name
CREATE FUNCTION reffunc(refcursor) RETURNS refcursor AS $$
BEGIN
    OPEN $1 FOR SELECT col FROM test;
    RETURN $1;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

BEGIN;
SELECT reffunc('funccursor');
FETCH ALL IN funccursor;
COMMIT;

-- Automatic Cursor Name Generation
CREATE FUNCTION reffunc2() RETURNS refcursor AS $$
DECLARE
    ref refcursor;
BEGIN
    OPEN ref FOR SELECT col FROM test;
    RETURN ref;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

BEGIN;
SELECT reffunc2();
FETCH ALL IN "";
COMMIT;

-- Returning Multiple Cursors
CREATE FUNCTION myfunc(refcursor, refcursor) RETURNS SETOF refcursor AS $$
BEGIN
    OPEN $1 FOR SELECT * FROM table_1;
    RETURN NEXT $1;
    OPEN $2 FOR SELECT * FROM table_2;
    RETURN NEXT $2;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

BEGIN;
SELECT * FROM myfunc('a', 'b');
FETCH ALL FROM a;
FETCH ALL FROM b;
COMMIT;
```

### Looping through a Cursor's Result

The `FOR` statement can be used to iterate through the rows returned by a cursor.

#### Example

```sql
FOR recordvar IN bound_cursorvar [ ( [ argument_name := ] argument_value [, ...] ) ] LOOP
    statements
END LOOP [ label ];

-- Example Usage
DECLARE
    curs CURSOR FOR SELECT * FROM tenk1;
    rowvar record;
BEGIN
    FOR rowvar IN curs LOOP
        -- Process each row
    END LOOP;
END;
```

This example demonstrates how to loop through the rows returned by a cursor using the `FOR` statement. The cursor variable `curs` is bound to a query, and the loop iterates through each row, assigning it to the `rowvar` variable.
