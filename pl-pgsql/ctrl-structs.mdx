## Control Structures in PL/pgSQL

Control structures are essential components of PL/pgSQL, enabling flexible and powerful manipulation of PostgreSQL data. This documentation covers various control structures, including returning from functions and procedures, conditionals, loops, and error handling.

### Returning from Functions

Functions in PL/pgSQL can return data using the `RETURN` and `RETURN NEXT` commands.

#### RETURN

The `RETURN` command terminates a function and returns the value of an expression to the caller. It is used for functions that do not return a set.

- **Scalar Return**: For functions returning a scalar type, the expression's result is automatically cast into the function's return type.
- **Composite Return**: For functions returning a composite type, an expression delivering exactly the requested column set must be written. This may require explicit casting.

```sql
-- Example of a function returning a scalar type
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION add_two_numbers(a int, b int) RETURNS int AS
$$
BEGIN
    RETURN a + b;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Example of a function returning a composite type
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_employee_info(id int) RETURNS TABLE(name text, age int) AS
$$
DECLARE
    r record;
BEGIN
    SELECT name, age INTO r FROM employees WHERE employee_id = id;
    RETURN r;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### RETURN NEXT and RETURN QUERY

`RETURN NEXT` and `RETURN QUERY` are used for functions declared to return `SETOF sometype`. These commands append rows to the function's result set.

- **RETURN NEXT**: Appends a single row to the result set.
- **RETURN QUERY**: Appends the results of executing a query to the result set.

```sql
-- Example using RETURN NEXT
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_all_employees() RETURNS SETOF employees AS
$$
DECLARE
    r employees%rowtype;
BEGIN
    FOR r IN SELECT * FROM employees LOOP
        RETURN NEXT r;
    END LOOP;
    RETURN;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Example using RETURN QUERY
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_available_flights(date) RETURNS SETOF integer AS
$$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY SELECT flightid FROM flights WHERE flightdate >= $1 AND flightdate < ($1 + 1);
    RETURN;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Returning from Procedures

Procedures do not have return values. They can end without a `RETURN` statement, or use `RETURN` with no expression to exit early.

```sql
-- Example of a procedure
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE update_employee_salary(id int, new_salary numeric) AS
$$
BEGIN
    UPDATE employees SET salary = new_salary WHERE employee_id = id;
    RETURN;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

### Calling a Procedure

Procedures are called using the `CALL` statement. Output parameters are handled by assigning the procedure's return values to variables.

```sql
-- Example of calling a procedure
DO $$
DECLARE
    myvar int := 5;
BEGIN
    CALL triple(myvar);
    RAISE NOTICE 'myvar = %', myvar;
END;
$$;
```

### Conditionals

PL/pgSQL supports `IF` and `CASE` statements for conditional execution.

#### IF-THEN

The simplest form of `IF` statement executes statements if a condition is true.

```sql
-- Example of IF-THEN
IF v_user_id <> 0 THEN
    UPDATE users SET email = v_email WHERE user_id = v_user_id;
END IF;
```

#### IF-THEN-ELSE

This form adds an alternative set of statements to execute if the condition is not true.

```sql
-- Example of IF-THEN-ELSE
IF parentid IS NULL OR parentid = '' THEN
    RETURN fullname;
ELSE
    RETURN hp_true_filename(parentid) || '/' || fullname;
END IF;
```

#### IF-THEN-ELSIF

This form checks multiple conditions in succession.

```sql
-- Example of IF-THEN-ELSIF
IF number = 0 THEN
    result := 'zero';
ELSIF number > 0 THEN
    result := 'positive';
ELSIF number < 0 THEN
    result := 'negative';
ELSE
    result := 'NULL';
END IF;
```

#### Simple CASE

Executes statements based on equality of operands.

```sql
-- Example of simple CASE
CASE x
    WHEN 1, 2 THEN
        msg := 'one or two';
    ELSE
        msg := 'other value than one or two';
END CASE;
```

#### Searched CASE

Executes statements based on truth of Boolean expressions.

```sql
-- Example of searched CASE
CASE
    WHEN x BETWEEN 0 AND 10 THEN
        msg := 'value is between zero and ten';
    WHEN x BETWEEN 11 AND 20 THEN
        msg := 'value is between eleven and twenty';
END CASE;
```

### Loops

PL/pgSQL supports several types of loops.

#### LOOP

An unconditional loop that repeats indefinitely until terminated by an `EXIT` or `RETURN` statement.

```sql
-- Example of LOOP
LOOP
    -- some computations
    IF count > 0 THEN
        EXIT;
    END IF;
END LOOP;
```

#### EXIT

Terminates the innermost loop and executes the statement following `END LOOP`.

```sql
-- Example of EXIT
LOOP
    -- some computations
    EXIT WHEN count > 0;
END LOOP;
```

#### CONTINUE

Skips the remaining statements in the loop body and returns to the loop control expression.

```sql
-- Example of CONTINUE
LOOP
    -- some computations
    CONTINUE WHEN count < 50;
    -- some computations for count IN [50 .. 100]
END LOOP;
```

#### WHILE

Repeats a sequence of statements as long as a condition is true.

```sql
-- Example of WHILE
WHILE amount_owed > 0 AND gift_certificate_balance > 0 LOOP
    -- some computations here
END LOOP;
```

#### FOR (Integer Variant)

Creates a loop that iterates over a range of integer values.

```sql
-- Example of FOR (Integer Variant)
FOR i IN 1..10 LOOP
    -- i will take on the values 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10 within the loop
END LOOP;
```

#### FOR (Query Variant)

Iterates through the results of a query and manipulates the data accordingly.

```sql
-- Example of FOR (Query Variant)
FOR mviews IN
    SELECT n.nspname AS mv_schema,
           c.relname AS mv_name,
           pg_catalog.pg_get_userbyid(c.relowner) AS owner
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_class c
    LEFT JOIN pg_catalog.pg_namespace n ON (n.oid = c.relnamespace)
    WHERE c.relkind = 'm'
LOOP
    -- Now "mviews" has one record with information about the materialized view
    RAISE NOTICE 'Refreshing materialized view %.% (owner: %)...',
                 quote_ident(mviews.mv_schema),
                 quote_ident(mviews.mv_name),
                 quote_ident(m

```
