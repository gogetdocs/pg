## PL/pgSQL Basic Statements

PL/pgSQL is a procedural language for PostgreSQL that allows you to write functions, triggers, and other database objects. Here are the basic statements used in PL/pgSQL:

### Assignment

Assignment in PL/pgSQL is used to assign a value to a variable. The syntax for assignment is as follows:

```sql
variable { := | = } expression;
```

You can use either `:=` or `=` as the assignment operator. Here is an example:

```sql
tax := subtotal * 0.06;
my_record.user_id := 20;
my_array[j] := 20;
my_array[1:3] := array[1,2,3];
complex_array[n].realpart = 12.3;
```

### Executing SQL Commands

Any SQL command that does not return rows can be executed within a PL/pgSQL function by simply writing the command. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mytable (id int primary key, data text);
INSERT INTO mytable VALUES (1,'one'), (2,'two');
```

If the command returns rows, you can use the `INTO` clause to capture the output. For example:

```sql
SELECT * INTO myrec FROM emp WHERE empname = myname;
```

### Executing a Command with a Single-Row Result

The result of an SQL command yielding a single row can be assigned to a record variable, row-type variable, or list of scalar variables using the `INTO` clause. For example:

```sql
SELECT * INTO myrec FROM emp WHERE empname = myname;
```

You can also use the `STRICT` option to ensure that the command returns exactly one row. For example:

```sql
SELECT * INTO STRICT myrec FROM emp WHERE empname = myname;
```

### Executing Dynamic Commands

Dynamic commands can be executed using the `EXECUTE` statement. For example:

```sql
EXECUTE 'SELECT count(*) FROM mytable WHERE inserted_by = $1 AND inserted <= $2'
INTO c
USING checked_user, checked_date;
```

You can also use the `format()` function to safely construct dynamic queries. For example:

```sql
EXECUTE format('UPDATE tbl SET %I = $1 WHERE key = $2', colname)
USING newvalue, keyvalue;
```

### Obtaining the Result Status

You can use the `GET DIAGNOSTICS` command to retrieve system status indicators. For example:

```sql
GET DIAGNOSTICS integer_var = ROW_COUNT;
```

You can also use the `FOUND` variable to determine whether a row was returned by a command. For example:

```sql
SELECT * INTO myrec FROM emp WHERE empname = myname;
IF NOT FOUND THEN
    RAISE EXCEPTION 'employee % not found', myname;
END IF;
```

### Doing Nothing At All

Sometimes a placeholder statement that does nothing is useful. For example:

```sql
NULL;
```

### PERFORM Statement

The `PERFORM` statement is used to execute a query and discard the result. For example:

```sql
PERFORM test();
```

You can also use the `PERFORM` statement to execute a query with a single-row result. For example:

```sql
PERFORM (SELECT * FROM mytable);
```

### Usages

Here are some usages of PL/pgSQL basic statements:

**Example 1: Creating a Function to Calculate Tax**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION calculate_tax(subtotal numeric)
RETURNS numeric AS $$
DECLARE
    tax numeric;
BEGIN
    tax := subtotal * 0.06;
    RETURN tax;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Example 2: Creating a Function to Insert Data into a Table**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION insert_data(id int, data text)
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO mytable (id, data) VALUES (id, data);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Example 3: Creating a Function to Update Data in a Table**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_data(id int, data text)
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    UPDATE mytable SET data = data WHERE id = id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Example 4: Creating a Function to Execute a Dynamic Query**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION execute_dynamic_query(tabname text, colname text, newvalue text)
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    EXECUTE format('UPDATE %I SET %I = %L', tabname, colname, newvalue);
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

**Example 5: Creating a Function to Use the PERFORM Statement**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION perform_test()
RETURNS void AS $$
BEGIN
    PERFORM test();
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

These examples demonstrate how to use PL/pgSQL basic statements to create functions that perform various tasks, such as calculating tax, inserting data into a table, updating data in a table, executing dynamic queries, and using the `PERFORM` statement. [1][6][7]
