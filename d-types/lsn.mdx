# **pg_lsn Type Documentation**

## **Overview**

The `pg_lsn` data type is used to store Log Sequence Number (LSN) data, which is a pointer to a location in the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) stream. This type is a representation of `XLogRecPtr` and an internal system type of PostgreSQL.

## **Internal Representation**

Internally, an LSN is a 64-bit integer, representing a byte position in the write-ahead log stream. It is printed as two hexadecimal numbers of up to 8 digits each, separated by a slash; for example, `16/B374D848`.

## **Operators**

The `pg_lsn` type supports the following operators:

### Comparison Operators

- `=`: equality operator
- `>`: greater than operator
- `<`: less than operator
- `>=` : greater than or equal to operator
- `<=` : less than or equal to operator

### Arithmetic Operators

- `-` : subtraction operator (returns the number of bytes separating two LSNs)
- `+` : addition operator (adds a numeric value to an LSN)
- `-` : subtraction operator (subtracts a numeric value from an LSN)

## **Examples**

### Comparison Operators

```sql
SELECT '16/B374D848'::pg_lsn = '16/B374D848'::pg_lsn;  -- returns true
SELECT '16/B374D848'::pg_lsn > '16/B374D847'::pg_lsn;  -- returns true
```

### Arithmetic Operators

```sql
SELECT '16/B374D848'::pg_lsn - '16/B374D847'::pg_lsn;  -- returns 1
SELECT '16/B374D848'::pg_lsn + 10;  -- returns '16/B374D852'::pg_lsn
SELECT '16/B374D848'::pg_lsn - 10;  -- returns '16/B374D838'::pg_lsn
```

## **Important Notes**

- The calculated LSN should be in the range of `pg_lsn` type, i.e., between `0/0` and `FFFFFFFF/FFFFFFFF`.
- When adding or subtracting a numeric value to/from an LSN, the result should be within the valid range of `pg_lsn` type.

## **Usage**

The `pg_lsn` type is commonly used in PostgreSQL replication and backup/recovery scenarios. For example:

```sql
-- Get the current LSN of a replication slot
SELECT pg_current_wal_lsn();

-- Get the LSN of a specific WAL file
SELECT pg_walfile_name_offset('000000010000000000000001');

-- Calculate the difference between two LSNs
SELECT '16/B374D848'::pg_lsn - '16/B374D847'::pg_lsn;
```

In a scenario, you might use the `pg_lsn` type to track the progress of a replication slot or to calculate the difference between two WAL files. For example:

```sql
-- Create a table to track replication progress
CREATE TABLE replication_progress (
    slot_name text,
    lsn pg_lsn
);

-- Insert the current LSN of a replication slot
INSERT INTO replication_progress (slot_name, lsn)
VALUES ('my_slot', pg_current_wal_lsn());

-- Calculate the difference between the current LSN and the previous LSN
SELECT lsn - LAG(lsn) OVER (ORDER BY slot_name)
FROM replication_progress;
```
