# **Enumerated Types in PostgreSQL**

## **Overview**

Enumerated (enum) types in PostgreSQL are data types that comprise a static, ordered set of values. They are equivalent to the enum types supported in a number of programming languages. Enum types are useful for representing a fixed set of values, such as the days of the week or a set of status values for a piece of data.

## **Declaration of Enumerated Types**

Enum types are created using the `CREATE TYPE` command. Here is an example:

```sql
CREATE TYPE mood AS ENUM ('sad', 'ok', 'happy');
```

Once created, the enum type can be used in table and function definitions much like any other type:

```sql
CREATE TABLE person (
    name text,
    current_mood mood
);

INSERT INTO person VALUES ('Moe', 'happy');

SELECT * FROM person WHERE current_mood = 'happy';
```

Result:

```
 name | current_mood
------+--------------
 Moe  | happy
(1 row)
```

## **Ordering**

The ordering of the values in an enum type is the order in which the values were listed when the type was created. All standard comparison operators and related aggregate functions are supported for enums. Here is an example:

```sql
INSERT INTO person VALUES ('Larry', 'sad');
INSERT INTO person VALUES ('Curly', 'ok');

SELECT * FROM person WHERE current_mood > 'sad';
```

Result:

```
 name  | current_mood
-------+--------------
 Moe   | happy
 Curly | ok
(2 rows)
```

## **Type Safety**

Each enumerated data type is separate and cannot be compared with other enumerated types. Here is an example:

```sql
CREATE TYPE happiness AS ENUM ('happy', 'very happy', 'ecstatic');
CREATE TABLE holidays (
    num_weeks integer,
    happiness happiness
);

INSERT INTO holidays(num_weeks,happiness) VALUES (4, 'happy');
INSERT INTO holidays(num_weeks,happiness) VALUES (6, 'very happy');
INSERT INTO holidays(num_weeks,happiness) VALUES (8, 'ecstatic');

-- This will raise an error
INSERT INTO holidays(num_weeks,happiness) VALUES (2, 'sad');

-- This will also raise an error
SELECT person.name, holidays.num_weeks FROM person, holidays
  WHERE person.current_mood = holidays.happiness;

-- To compare enum values from different types, use explicit casts
SELECT person.name, holidays.num_weeks FROM person, holidays
  WHERE person.current_mood::text = holidays.happiness::text;
```

Result:

```
 name | num_weeks
------+-----------
 Moe  |         4
(1 row)
```

## **Implementation Details**

Enum labels are case sensitive, so 'happy' is not the same as 'HAPPY'. White space in the labels is significant too.

Although enum types are primarily intended for static sets of values, there is support for adding new values to an existing enum type, and for renaming values (see `ALTER TYPE`). Existing values cannot be removed from an enum type, nor can the sort ordering of such values be changed, short of dropping and re-creating the enum type.

An enum value occupies four bytes on disk. The length of an enum value's textual label is limited by the `NAMEDATALEN` setting compiled into PostgreSQL; in standard builds this means at most 63 bytes.

The translations from internal enum values to textual labels are kept in the system catalog `pg_enum`. Querying this catalog directly can be useful.

## **Usage**

Here is an example of using enum types in a scenario:

```sql
CREATE TYPE order_status AS ENUM ('pending', 'shipped', 'delivered', 'cancelled');

CREATE TABLE orders (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name text,
    order_date date,
    status order_status
);

INSERT INTO orders (customer_name, order_date, status) VALUES ('John Doe', '2022-01-01', 'pending');
INSERT INTO orders (customer_name, order_date, status) VALUES ('Jane Doe', '2022-01-15', 'shipped');

SELECT * FROM orders WHERE status = 'pending';
```

Result:

```
 id | customer_name | order_date | status
----+---------------+------------+--------
  1 | John Doe      | 2022-01-01 | pending
(1 row)
```

In this example, we create an enum type `order_status` to represent the different statuses of an order. We then create a table `orders` that uses this enum type to store the status of each order. We can then use the enum type to filter orders by status.
