## Range Types in PostgreSQL

Range types in PostgreSQL represent a range of values of some element type (called the range's subtype). They are useful for representing many element values in a single range value and for expressing concepts such as overlapping ranges clearly.

### Built-in Range and Multirange Types

PostgreSQL comes with several built-in range types:

- **int4range**: Range of integer
- **int8range**: Range of bigint
- **numrange**: Range of numeric
- **tsrange**: Range of timestamp without time zone
- **tstzrange**: Range of timestamp with time zone
- **daterange**: Range of date

Each range type has a corresponding multirange type (e.g., **int4multirange**, **int8multirange**, etc.)[1].

### Examples

#### Creating a Table with a Range Type

```sql
CREATE TABLE reservation (
    room int,
    during tsrange
);

INSERT INTO reservation VALUES
(1108, '[2010-01-01 14:30, 2010-01-01 15:30)');
```

#### Range Operations

```sql
-- Containment
SELECT int4range(10, 20) @> 3;

-- Overlaps
SELECT numrange(11.1, 22.2) && numrange(20.0, 30.0);

-- Extract the upper bound
SELECT upper(int8range(15, 25));

-- Compute the intersection
SELECT int4range(10, 20) * int4range(15, 25);

-- Is the range empty?
SELECT isempty(numrange(1, 5));
```

### Inclusive and Exclusive Bounds

Every non-empty range has two bounds, the lower bound and the upper bound. An inclusive bound includes the boundary point in the range, while an exclusive bound does not.

- **Inclusive lower bound**: Represented by `[`
- **Exclusive lower bound**: Represented by `(`
- **Inclusive upper bound**: Represented by `]`
- **Exclusive upper bound**: Represented by `)`

```sql
-- Includes 3, does not include 7, and includes all points in between
SELECT '[3,7)'::int4range;

-- Does not include either 3 or 7, but includes all points in between
SELECT '(3,7)'::int4range;

-- Includes only the single point 4
SELECT '[4,4]'::int4range;

-- Includes no points (and will be normalized to 'empty')
SELECT '[4,4)'::int4range;
```

### Infinite (Unbounded) Ranges

The lower or upper bound of a range can be omitted to represent infinite ranges.

```sql
-- All values less than the upper bound
SELECT '(,3]'::int4range;

-- All values greater than the lower bound
SELECT '[3,)'::int4range;

-- All values of the element type
SELECT '(,)'::int4range;
```

### Range Input/Output

The input for a range value must follow specific patterns:

- **(lower-bound,upper-bound)**
- **(lower-bound,upper-bound]**
- **[lower-bound,upper-bound)**
- **[lower-bound,upper-bound]**
- **empty**

Each bound value can be quoted using double quotes (`"`) to include special characters.

```sql
SELECT '[3,7)'::int4range;
SELECT '(3,7)'::int4range;
SELECT '[4,4]'::int4range;
SELECT '[4,4)'::int4range;
```

### Constructing Ranges and Multiranges

Each range type has a constructor function that accepts two or three arguments. The two-argument form constructs a range in standard form (lower bound inclusive, upper bound exclusive), while the three-argument form allows specifying the inclusivity/exclusivity of the bounds.

```sql
-- Full form with inclusivity/exclusivity
SELECT numrange(1.0, 14.0, '(]');

-- Standard form assumed if third argument is omitted
SELECT numrange(1.0, 14.0);

-- Using NULL for unbounded sides
SELECT numrange(NULL, 2.2);
```

### Discrete Range Types

A discrete range type has a well-defined “step” between element values, such as integer or date. These types allow for canonicalization to ensure consistent representation of equivalent ranges.

```sql
-- Discrete range type example
SELECT int8range(1, 14, '(]');

-- Canonical form used for display
SELECT int8range(1, 14);
```

### Defining New Range Types

Users can define their own range types using the `CREATE TYPE` command.

```sql
-- Define a new range type for float8
CREATE TYPE floatrange AS RANGE (
    subtype = float8,
    subtype_diff = float8mi
);

SELECT '[1.234, 5.678]'::floatrange;
```

### Indexing

GiST and SP-GiST indexes can be created for table columns of range types to accelerate queries involving range operators.

```sql
-- Create a GiST index on a range column
CREATE INDEX reservation_idx ON reservation USING GIST (during);
```

### Constraints on Ranges

Exclusion constraints can be used to enforce non-overlapping ranges in a table.

```sql
-- Create a table with an exclusion constraint
CREATE TABLE reservation (
    during tsrange,
    EXCLUDE USING GIST (during WITH &&)
);

-- Attempt to insert overlapping ranges
INSERT INTO reservation VALUES
('[2010-01-01 11:30, 2010-01-01 15:00)');
INSERT INTO reservation VALUES
('[2010-01-01 14:45, 2010-01-01 15:45)');
```

### Usage

#### Scheduling Meetings

```sql
-- Create a table for meeting reservations
CREATE TABLE meeting_reservation (
    room text,
    during tsrange,
    EXCLUDE USING GIST (room WITH =, during WITH &&)
);

-- Insert meeting reservations
INSERT INTO meeting_reservation VALUES
('123A', '[2010-01-01 14:00, 2010-01-01 15:00)');
INSERT INTO meeting_reservation VALUES
('123A', '[2010-01-01 14:30, 2010-01-01 15:30)'); -- This will fail due to overlap
INSERT INTO meeting_reservation VALUES
('123B', '[2010-01-01 14:30, 2010-01-01 15:30)'); -- This will succeed
```
