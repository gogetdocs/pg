## Monetary Types in PostgreSQL

### Overview

The `money` type in PostgreSQL is used to store currency amounts with a fixed fractional precision. The precision is determined by the database's `lc_monetary` setting.

### Characteristics

- **Storage Size**: 8 bytes
- **Description**: Currency amount
- **Range**: -92233720368547758.08 to +92233720368547758.07 (assuming two fractional digits)

### Input and Output

Input is accepted in various formats, including:

- Integer literals: `1000`
- Floating-point literals: `1000.00`
- Typical currency formatting: `'$1,000.00'`

Output is generally in the latter form but depends on the locale.

### Important Considerations

- The output of this data type is locale-sensitive, so it may not work to load money data into a database with a different `lc_monetary` setting.
- To avoid problems, ensure `lc_monetary` has the same or equivalent value as in the database that was dumped before restoring a dump into a new database.

### Casting and Conversion

Values of the `numeric`, `int`, and `bigint` data types can be cast to `money`. Conversion from the `real` and `double precision` data types can be done by casting to `numeric` first:

```sql
SELECT '12.34'::float8::numeric::money;
```

However, this is not recommended due to the potential for rounding errors.

A `money` value can be cast to `numeric` without loss of precision. Conversion to other types could potentially lose precision and must be done in two stages:

```sql
SELECT '52093.89'::money::numeric::float8;
```

### Division and Rounding

Division of a `money` value by an integer value is performed with truncation of the fractional part towards zero. To get a rounded result, divide by a floating-point value, or cast the `money` value to `numeric` before dividing and back to `money` afterwards:

```sql
SELECT '100.00'::money / 3;  -- Result: 33.33 (truncated)
SELECT '100.00'::money / 3.0;  -- Result: 33.33 (rounded)
SELECT ('100.00'::money::numeric / 3)::money;  -- Result: 33.33 (rounded)
```

When a `money` value is divided by another `money` value, the result is `double precision` (i.e., a pure number, not `money`); the currency units cancel each other out in the division:

```sql
SELECT '100.00'::money / '50.00'::money;  -- Result: 2.0 (double precision)
```
