## Domain Types

A domain is a user-defined data type that is based on another underlying type. It can have constraints that restrict its valid values to a subset of what the underlying type would allow.

### Creating a Domain

To create a domain, use the `CREATE DOMAIN` command. For example, we can create a domain over integers that accepts only positive integers:

```sql
CREATE DOMAIN posint AS integer CHECK (VALUE > 0);
```

This creates a new domain type called `posint` that is based on the `integer` type and has a constraint that only allows values greater than 0.

### Using a Domain in a Table

We can use the `posint` domain in a table like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE mytable (id posint);
```

This creates a table called `mytable` with a column called `id` that has the `posint` domain type.

### Inserting Values into a Domain Column

We can insert values into the `id` column like this:

```sql
INSERT INTO mytable VALUES(1);   -- works
INSERT INTO mytable VALUES(-1);  -- fails
```

The first insert statement works because the value 1 is a positive integer, which is allowed by the `posint` domain. The second insert statement fails because the value -1 is not a positive integer, which is not allowed by the `posint` domain.

### Down-Casting a Domain Value

When an operator or function of the underlying type is applied to a domain value, the domain is automatically down-cast to the underlying type. For example:

```sql
SELECT mytable.id - 1 FROM mytable;
```

This query subtracts 1 from the `id` column, which is of type `posint`. The result is considered to be of type `integer`, not `posint`.

### Casting a Value Back to a Domain Type

We can cast the result back to the `posint` domain type like this:

```sql
SELECT (mytable.id - 1)::posint FROM mytable;
```

This query casts the result of the subtraction back to the `posint` domain type, which causes the domain's constraints to be rechecked. If the expression had been applied to an `id` value of 1, this would result in an error.

### Assigning a Value of the Underlying Type to a Domain Column

We can assign a value of the underlying type to a field or variable of the domain type without writing an explicit cast:

```sql
UPDATE mytable SET id = 2;
```

This update statement sets the `id` column to the value 2, which is a positive integer and is allowed by the `posint` domain. The domain's constraints will be checked when the assignment is made.
