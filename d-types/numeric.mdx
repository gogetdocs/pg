## Numeric Types in PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL provides a variety of numeric types to handle different kinds of numerical data. These types include integers, arbitrary precision numbers, floating-point numbers, and serial types.

### Integer Types

Integer types are used to store whole numbers without fractional components. There are three main integer types:

- **smallint**: 2 bytes, range from -32768 to +32767.
- **integer**: 4 bytes, range from -2147483648 to +2147483647. This is the most commonly used integer type due to its balance between range, storage size, and performance.
- **bigint**: 8 bytes, range from -9223372036854775808 to +9223372036854775807. This type is used when the range of the integer type is insufficient.

**Example Usage:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    age smallint,
    salary bigint
);

INSERT INTO employees (id, age, salary) VALUES (1, 30, 100000);
```

### Arbitrary Precision Numbers

The **numeric** type can store numbers with a very large number of digits and is particularly useful for storing monetary amounts and other quantities where exactness is required.

- **numeric(precision, scale)**: The precision is the total count of significant digits, and the scale is the count of decimal digits. For example, `numeric(3, 1)` can store values between -99.9 and 99.9.

**Example Usage:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE invoices (
    id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    amount numeric(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO invoices (id, amount) VALUES (1, 123.45);
```

### Floating-Point Types

Floating-point types are inexact, variable-precision numeric types.

- **real**: 4 bytes, variable-precision, inexact, with a precision of at least 6 decimal digits.
- **double precision**: 8 bytes, variable-precision, inexact, with a precision of at least 15 decimal digits.

**Example Usage:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE measurements (
    id integer PRIMARY KEY,
    temperature real,
    weight double precision
);

INSERT INTO measurements (id, temperature, weight) VALUES (1, 23.5, 100.123456789);
```

### Serial Types

Serial types are not true types but a notational convenience for creating unique identifier columns.

- **smallserial**: 2 bytes, small autoincrementing integer, range from 1 to 32767.
- **serial**: 4 bytes, autoincrementing integer, range from 1 to 2147483647.
- **bigserial**: 8 bytes, large autoincrementing integer, range from 1 to 9223372036854775807.

**Example Usage:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    id serial PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id integer
);

INSERT INTO orders (customer_id) VALUES (1);
-- The id will be autoincremented.
```

### Special Values

Both numeric and floating-point types support special values:

- **Infinity**: Represents a value larger than any finite number.
- **-Infinity**: Represents a value smaller than any finite number.
- **NaN (Not-a-Number)**: Represents an undefined or unreliable result.

**Example Usage:**

```sql
UPDATE measurements SET temperature = 'Infinity' WHERE id = 1;
```

### Important Notes

- **Rounding**: Numeric types round ties away from zero, while floating-point types round ties to the nearest even number.
- **Precision and Scale**: For numeric types, the precision and scale must be considered to avoid errors due to rounding or exceeding the declared precision.
- **Portability**: Using scales outside the range specified by the SQL standard (0 to precision) may not be portable to other database systems.
