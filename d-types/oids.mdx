## Object Identifier Types in PostgreSQL

Object identifiers (OIDs) are used internally by PostgreSQL as primary keys for various system tables. The `oid` type represents an object identifier, and there are several alias types for `oid`, each named `regsomething`. These alias types allow simplified lookup of OID values for objects.

### OID Type

The `oid` type is currently implemented as an unsigned four-byte integer. It has few operations beyond comparison, but it can be cast to `integer` and then manipulated using standard integer operators.

### OID Alias Types

The OID alias types have no operations of their own except for specialized input and output routines. These routines can accept and display symbolic names for system objects, rather than the raw numeric value that type `oid` would use.

#### regclass

The `regclass` type is used for relation names. It can be used to simplify lookup of OID values for tables.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_attribute WHERE attrelid = 'mytable'::regclass;
```

This is equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_attribute
  WHERE attrelid = (SELECT oid FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'mytable');
```

#### regcollation

The `regcollation` type is used for collation names.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_collation WHERE oid = 'POSIX'::regcollation;
```

#### regconfig

The `regconfig` type is used for text search configuration names.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_ts_config WHERE oid = 'english'::regconfig;
```

#### regdictionary

The `regdictionary` type is used for text search dictionary names.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_ts_dict WHERE oid = 'simple'::regdictionary;
```

#### regnamespace

The `regnamespace` type is used for namespace names.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_namespace WHERE oid = 'pg_catalog'::regnamespace;
```

#### regoper

The `regoper` type is used for operator names.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_operator WHERE oid = '+'::regoper;
```

#### regoperator

The `regoperator` type is used for operator names with argument types.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_operator WHERE oid = '*(integer, integer)'::regoperator;
```

#### regproc

The `regproc` type is used for function names.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE oid = 'sum'::regproc;
```

#### regprocedure

The `regprocedure` type is used for function names with argument types.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_proc WHERE oid = 'sum(int4)'::regprocedure;
```

#### regrole

The `regrole` type is used for role names.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_authid WHERE oid = 'smithee'::regrole;
```

#### regtype

The `regtype` type is used for data type names.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_type WHERE oid = 'integer'::regtype;
```

### Using OID Alias Types

The OID alias types can be used to simplify lookup of OID values for objects. For example, to examine the `pg_attribute` rows related to a table `mytable`, one could write:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_attribute WHERE attrelid = 'mytable'::regclass;
```

This is equivalent to:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_attribute
  WHERE attrelid = (SELECT oid FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'mytable');
```

### Dependencies

Constants of OID alias types can create dependencies on the referenced object. For example, if a column has a default expression `nextval('my_seq'::regclass)`, PostgreSQL understands that the default expression depends on the sequence `my_seq`, so the system will not let the sequence be dropped without first removing the default expression.

### Other Identifier Types

There are several other identifier types used by the system:

- `xid`: transaction identifier (32-bit)
- `xid8`: 64-bit variant of `xid` (strictly monotonically increasing)
- `cid`: command identifier (32-bit)
- `tid`: tuple identifier (row identifier, a pair of block number and tuple index within block)

These identifier types are used in system columns such as `xmin`, `xmax`, `cmin`, `cmax`, and `ctid`.
