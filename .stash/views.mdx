In PostgreSQL, **views** are essentially stored SQL queries. They allow you to represent complex queries as simple virtual tables, which can then be queried just like a regular table. Views are useful for encapsulating complex SQL logic, securing sensitive data by exposing only necessary fields, and simplifying repeated queries. PostgreSQL supports **read-only** and **updatable views**, with the latter allowing INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations under certain conditions.

### 1. Basic View Creation

You can create a view to encapsulate a query and reuse it for easier access.

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE status = 'active';
```

Now, querying the view becomes easy:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_view;
```

This will return all active employees from the `employees` table.

### 2. Using Joins in Views

Views can encapsulate complex queries, such as joining multiple tables. For instance, combining `employees` and `departments`:

```sql
CREATE VIEW department_employees AS
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.status = 'active';
```

Now you can query the `department_employees` view:

```sql
SELECT * FROM department_employees WHERE department_name = 'HR';
```

This query lists all active employees in the HR department.

### 3. Using Aggregate Functions in Views

Views can also be used to represent aggregated data, such as totals or averages.

```sql
CREATE VIEW department_salary_avg AS
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

This view can be used to fetch the average salary per department:

```sql
SELECT * FROM department_salary_avg;
```

### 4. Updatable Views

In PostgreSQL, views can sometimes be **updatable**, meaning you can `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` data through the view. A simple updatable view can be created like this:

```sql
CREATE VIEW active_employees AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department_id
FROM employees
WHERE status = 'active';
```

Now, you can update the underlying table through the view:

```sql
UPDATE active_employees
SET department_id = 3
WHERE employee_id = 5;
```

This updates the `department_id` in the `employees` table for employee 5.

### 5. Creating Views with Security Features

Views can restrict access to certain columns, allowing you to expose only the necessary data to users. This can be helpful for security reasons, especially when you need to prevent users from accessing sensitive columns.

```sql
CREATE VIEW public_employee_info AS
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department_id
FROM employees;
```

Here, columns like `salary` and `personal_info` are excluded, so anyone querying this view will not have access to that data.

### 6. Parameterized Views Using Functions

While PostgreSQL views cannot take parameters, you can create **functions** that return the result of a query similar to a view, but allow parameters.

Example: A function that acts like a view but takes a department ID as input:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_employees_by_department(dept_id INT)
RETURNS TABLE(employee_id INT, first_name TEXT, last_name TEXT) AS $$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name
    FROM employees
    WHERE department_id = dept_id;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

You can call this function like:

```sql
SELECT * FROM get_employees_by_department(2);
```

### 7. Materialized Views

A **materialized view** stores the result of the query physically, which can improve performance for expensive queries. However, it needs to be manually refreshed.

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_salary_summary AS
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;
```

You can **refresh** the materialized view to update its data:

```sql
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_salary_summary;
```

Querying a materialized view works the same way as a regular view:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_salary_summary;
```

### 8. Dropping Views

If you need to remove a view, use the `DROP VIEW` command:

```sql
DROP VIEW employee_view;
```

To drop a materialized view:

```sql
DROP MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_salary_summary;
```

### 9. Complex Views with CTEs (Common Table Expressions)

You can create views that use CTEs to build up complex queries in a more readable way.

```sql
CREATE VIEW department_employee_stats AS
WITH department_totals AS (
    SELECT department_id, COUNT(employee_id) AS total_employees
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
),
department_salaries AS (
    SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
    FROM employees
    GROUP BY department_id
)
SELECT dt.department_id, dt.total_employees, ds.avg_salary
FROM department_totals dt
JOIN department_salaries ds ON dt.department_id = ds.department_id;
```

Now you can query the view to get the employee count and average salary per department:

```sql
SELECT * FROM department_employee_stats;
```

### 10. Indexed Materialized Views

For better query performance, you can even add an index to a materialized view:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_department_avg_salary ON employee_salary_summary(department_id);
```

### 11. View Dependencies

To check the dependencies for a view (which tables and columns it depends on), you can query the `pg_catalog` system tables:

```sql
SELECT
    viewname,
    pg_catalog.pg_get_viewdef(c.oid, true) AS definition
FROM
    pg_catalog.pg_views v
JOIN
    pg_catalog.pg_class c ON v.viewname = c.relname
WHERE
    viewname = 'employee_view';
```

This query shows the definition of the view `employee_view`.

Views in PostgreSQL are powerful tools that can simplify complex queries, provide security, enhance performance, and even create materialized views for caching purposes. Below are advanced ways to leverage PostgreSQL views for different scenarios:

### 1. **Parameterized Views Using Functions**

PostgreSQL views don’t accept parameters directly. However, you can achieve parameterization using functions combined with views. For example, you can use a `PL/pgSQL` function to return a query based on a parameter.

#### Example: View with a Function

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
SELECT id, name, department, salary FROM employees;

-- Function to fetch employees by department
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_employees_by_department(dept_name TEXT)
RETURNS TABLE (id INT, name TEXT, department TEXT, salary NUMERIC) AS
$$
BEGIN
    RETURN QUERY
    SELECT * FROM employee_view WHERE department = dept_name;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

You can then call this function with parameters:

```sql
SELECT * FROM get_employees_by_department('Sales');
```

### 2. **Updatable Views (INSTEAD OF Triggers)**

PostgreSQL allows you to create updatable views by defining `INSTEAD OF` triggers. This enables you to insert, update, and delete rows from views, even if they are based on complex joins.

#### Example: Updatable View

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_department AS
SELECT e.id, e.name, e.salary, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;

-- Create trigger for updates
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_employee_department() RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    IF TG_OP = 'UPDATE' THEN
        UPDATE employees SET name = NEW.name, salary = NEW.salary WHERE id = OLD.id;
        UPDATE departments SET department_name = NEW.department_name WHERE id = OLD.department_id;
        RETURN NEW;
    END IF;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

-- Attach trigger to view
CREATE TRIGGER employee_department_upd_trig
INSTEAD OF UPDATE ON employee_department
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION update_employee_department();
```

Now you can update the view as if it were a table:

```sql
UPDATE employee_department SET salary = 75000 WHERE id = 101;
```

### 3. **Materialized Views**

Materialized views store the result of a query physically on disk, unlike regular views that are virtual. This can improve query performance for large datasets but requires manual refreshing when the underlying data changes.

#### Example: Materialized View

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_salary_summary AS
SELECT department_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;

-- To refresh the materialized view (e.g., after data changes):
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_salary_summary;
```

Materialized views are useful when you need to query large datasets repeatedly without rerunning the full query.

### 4. **Views with Row-Level Security (RLS)**

Views can be combined with PostgreSQL’s **Row-Level Security (RLS)** to restrict access to data. This is especially useful for multi-tenant applications where different users should see only their own data.

#### Example: View with RLS

```sql
-- Enable RLS on the employees table
ALTER TABLE employees ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Define a security policy for the employees table
CREATE POLICY employee_policy ON employees
USING (current_user = manager_username);  -- Only rows where current user is the manager

-- Create a view to enforce RLS
CREATE VIEW employee_manager_view AS
SELECT id, name, salary FROM employees;

-- Grant access to the view (RLS applies automatically)
GRANT SELECT ON employee_manager_view TO managers;
```

With RLS, each manager will only see the employees they manage.

### 5. **Recursive Views**

Recursive views, in combination with **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**, allow you to handle hierarchical or recursive data structures like organization charts or family trees.

#### Example: Recursive View for Hierarchies

```sql
-- Employee table with self-references
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT,
    manager_id INT REFERENCES employees(id)
);

-- Create a recursive view to get all subordinates of a manager
WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
    SELECT id, name, manager_id, 1 AS level FROM employees WHERE manager_id IS NULL  -- Top-level managers
    UNION ALL
    SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id, eh.level + 1
    FROM employees e
    JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
)
SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;
```

This recursive view will return all employees in a hierarchical structure, showing how many levels deep each employee is.

### 6. **Complex Joins and Aggregations in Views**

Views can encapsulate complex business logic involving multiple joins, aggregations, and window functions. This simplifies the querying process for end users who only need to query the view without dealing with the underlying complexity.

#### Example: View with Complex Joins and Aggregation

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_performance_summary AS
SELECT e.id, e.name, d.department_name, COUNT(p.project_id) AS project_count, AVG(p.performance_score) AS avg_score
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
JOIN projects p ON e.id = p.employee_id
GROUP BY e.id, e.name, d.department_name;
```

This view combines data from multiple tables and performs aggregations. You can simply query this view instead of repeatedly writing complex joins and aggregations:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employee_performance_summary WHERE avg_score > 85;
```

### 7. **Indexed Views (Materialized Views + Indexes)**

While PostgreSQL doesn't support directly indexing normal views, you can use indexes with materialized views to enhance performance significantly.

#### Example: Index on Materialized View

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_department_summary AS
SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department_id;

-- Create an index to optimize queries
CREATE INDEX idx_department_id ON employee_department_summary (department_id);

-- Refresh the materialized view when necessary
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_department_summary;
```

This indexed materialized view allows fast querying, especially for frequent analytical queries.

### 8. **Partitioned Views for Data Sharding**

When working with large datasets, partitioned tables are essential for managing performance. You can create views that unify partitioned tables into a single queryable interface.

#### Example: Partitioned View

```sql
-- Create partitioned tables
CREATE TABLE employees_2023 PARTITION OF employees FOR VALUES FROM ('2023-01-01') TO ('2023-12-31');
CREATE TABLE employees_2022 PARTITION OF employees FOR VALUES FROM ('2022-01-01') TO ('2022-12-31');

-- Create a view to unify the partitions
CREATE VIEW all_employees AS
SELECT * FROM employees_2023
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM employees_2022;
```

This allows seamless querying across partitions while retaining the performance benefits of partitioning.

### 9. **Materialized Views with Auto Refresh**

Automatically refreshing materialized views can be essential in environments with frequently updated data. Although PostgreSQL doesn't have a built-in scheduler, you can use tools like **pg_cron** or external schedulers to refresh materialized views.

#### Example: Auto-Refreshing Materialized View

```bash
-- Assuming pg_cron is installed
SELECT cron.schedule('0 0 * * *', 'REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW employee_salary_summary');
```

This will automatically refresh the materialized view every day at midnight.
