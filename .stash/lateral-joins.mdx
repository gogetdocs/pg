Lateral joins in PostgreSQL are a powerful feature that allow you to refer to columns from a preceding table in the same query. They can be particularly useful when you want to call a function or subquery that requires values from each row of the outer query. The `LATERAL` keyword effectively allows the inner subquery to depend on the outer query, enabling more complex and dynamic queries.

### Key Uses of Lateral Joins:

1. **Row-by-Row Calculations**: You can perform calculations or transformations that depend on each row from the outer query. For example, if you want to apply a function that requires data from a specific row of another table.

2. **Working with Set-Returning Functions**: Lateral joins are particularly useful for invoking set-returning functions (SRFs) that return multiple rows. This allows you to generate rows based on each row of another table.

3. **More Complex Filtering**: You can filter data based on correlated subqueries, which can simplify complex queries that might otherwise require multiple subqueries or joins.

4. **Dynamic Result Sets**: They allow you to dynamically generate result sets based on the outer query's values, which can lead to more flexible and powerful queries.

### Syntax:

Here’s the basic syntax of a lateral join:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM outer_table
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT *
    FROM inner_table
    WHERE inner_table.foreign_key = outer_table.primary_key
) AS alias_name;
```

### Example Scenario:

Suppose you have two tables: `authors` and `books`. You want to find all authors along with their most recent book. Here’s how you might use a lateral join:

```sql
CREATE TABLE authors (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT
);

CREATE TABLE books (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    author_id INT REFERENCES authors(id),
    title TEXT,
    published_date DATE
);

-- Sample query using LATERAL
SELECT a.name, b.title, b.published_date
FROM authors a
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT title, published_date
    FROM books
    WHERE books.author_id = a.id
    ORDER BY published_date DESC
    LIMIT 1
) b;
```

### Explanation of the Example:

1. **Outer Query**: Iterates over each author in the `authors` table.
2. **Lateral Join**: For each author, it runs a subquery that retrieves the most recent book from the `books` table by filtering with the author’s ID.
3. **Results**: This will return a list of authors along with their most recent book title and publication date.
