### Introduction

- **Speakers**: Courtney Brown (Marketing Manager at EnterpriseDB), Pavani Rao (EDB Senior Product Marketing Manager), and Baron Schwartz (Founder and CTO of VividCortex).
- **Agenda**: Benefits of database monitoring, landscape of monitoring tools, and specific tools like Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) and VividCortex.

### Benefits of Monitoring

- **Low-Level Benefits**:
  - Better utilization of time and resources.
  - Capacity planning (e.g., disk space management).
  - Availability (e.g., backup and replication management).
  - Performance (query resolution times).
- **High-Level Benefits**:
  - Drive better user experience.
  - Manage costs.
  - Avoid downtime.

### Differences Between Databases and Typical Applications

- **Statefulness**: Databases are stateful, unlike many applications.
- **Workload Variability**: Databases have diverse and unpredictable workloads.
- **Complexity**: Databases have additional dimensions (e.g., SQL statements, explain plans) beyond typical time-series data.

### Monitoring Philosophy

- **Three Major Categories**:
  1. **Operating System and Hardware**: Input/output, memory utilization, network utilization, CPU, physical disk space.
  2. **Database Server**: DML/DDL logs, wait times, users, objects, replication, backups.
  3. **SQL and Queries**: Throughput, latency, concurrency, errors.

### Monitoring Roles

- **Operations**: Regular database monitoring, administration (e.g., creating tables, adding users).
- **Developers**: Focus on application responsiveness, database development (e.g., migrations, foreign data wrappers).
- **Database Administrators**: Comprehensive role including monitoring, administration, and development.

### Monitoring Questions

- **Common Questions**:
  - Did the backup complete successfully?
  - Which queries are consuming the most resources?
  - Is replication running and up-to-date?
  - Is the application encountering slow queries?
  - Did the auto-vacuum run?
  - Are the databases bloated?
  - Are configuration settings optimal?
