### 1. Preloading Libraries

- **Concept**: Preloading libraries in PostgreSQL can significantly improve performance by reducing the overhead of loading libraries for each new connection.
- **Example**: The speaker mentions using `plr` (a library for R) and notes that loading it on connection can take 220 milliseconds, which can be avoided by preloading.
- **Code Example**:
  ```sql
  -- Preloading libraries example
  -- In postgresql.conf or using ALTER SYSTEM
  shared_preload_libraries = 'plr';
  -- or for session-level preloading
  SET session_preload_libraries = 'plr';
  ```
- **Key Point**: Preloading can save a lot of overhead, especially with many connections.

### 2. Transaction Log Size

- **Concept**: The size of the transaction log (WAL) can impact performance. Using `wal_level = minimal` and adjusting `max_wal_size` can help.
- **Example**: The speaker compares running a test with `wal_level = logical` and `max_wal_size = 64MB` versus `wal_level = minimal` and `max_wal_size = 100GB`.
- **Code Example**:
  ```sql
  -- Adjusting WAL settings
  ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_level = 'minimal';
  ALTER SYSTEM SET max_wal_size = '100GB';
  ```
- **Key Point**: Reducing WAL size can improve performance by writing less data.

### 3. Indexing

- **Concept**: Proper indexing is crucial for performance. The fill factor of an index can be adjusted for static data.
- **Example**: The speaker mentions creating an index with a fill factor of 100% for static data, which can make the index smaller but may cause issues with dynamic data.
- **Code Example**:
  ```sql
  -- Creating an index with a specified fill factor
  CREATE INDEX idx_name ON table_name (column_name) WITH (FILLFACTOR = 100);
  ```
- **Key Point**: Adjusting the fill factor can be beneficial for static data but risky for dynamic data.

### 4. Join Order

- **Concept**: PostgreSQLâ€™s optimizer determines the join order, but this can be influenced using `join_collapse_limit`.
- **Example**: The speaker shows how to use `join_collapse_limit` to control the join order.
- **Code Example**:
  ```sql
  -- Adjusting join collapse limit
  SET join_collapse_limit = 8; -- Default value, can be adjusted
  ```
- **Key Point**: Controlling join order can improve planning time and execution performance.

### 5. Execution Order of Functions

- **Concept**: The execution order of functions in a query can be influenced by assigning costs to functions using `ALTER FUNCTION`.
- **Example**: The speaker demonstrates how to use `ALTER FUNCTION` to make the optimizer choose a more efficient execution order.
- **Code Example**:
  ```sql
  -- Altering function cost
  ALTER FUNCTION function_name COST 1000; -- Assign a higher cost to influence execution order
  ```
- **Key Point**: Assigning appropriate costs to functions can improve execution performance.

### 6. Generating SQL

- **Concept**: PostgreSQL allows generating SQL dynamically using `psql` commands like `\gexec`.
- **Example**: The speaker shows how to generate and execute SQL dynamically.
- **Code Example**:
  ```sql
  -- Generating and executing SQL dynamically
  SELECT format('CREATE TABLE %s (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY);', 'table_name') \gexec
  ```
- **Key Point**: Dynamic SQL generation can be useful for creating or manipulating many tables or indexes.

### 7. Additional Tips

- **Concept**: Various additional tips were mentioned, including the importance of understanding how PostgreSQL works under the hood and the potential pitfalls of certain optimizations.
- **Key Point**: Deep understanding and careful application of optimizations are crucial.
