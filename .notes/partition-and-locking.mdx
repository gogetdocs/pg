## Key Concepts

**Partitioning in PostgreSQL**

- Partitioning allows large tables to be divided into smaller, more manageable pieces while still appearing as a single logical table to users.
- It helps improve query performance by reducing the number of rows scanned and thus speeding up access times.

**Advantages of Partitioning**

- Queries can be optimized to access only relevant partitions based on partition keys, improving performance.
- Smaller partitions lead to smaller indexes, which are faster to query.

**Challenges with Partitioning**

- Partitioning can introduce complexities, such as managing multiple tables and handling lock contention.
- Each partition requires its own set of indexes, increasing the number of locks needed during queries.

**Lock Management in PostgreSQL**

- PostgreSQL uses locks to manage concurrent access to tables and indexes. These include table locks (access share locks) and row locks (row exclusive locks).
- The lock manager handles these locks but can become a bottleneck if too many locks are required, especially with numerous partitions.

**Fast Path Locking**

- Fast path locking is a mechanism that allows for quicker lock acquisition without using the lock manager for up to 16 relations per backend process.
- When this limit is exceeded, the system reverts to slower lock management methods, which can lead to contention.

## Examples and Issues

**Example Scenario**

- A production system experienced performance degradation due to lock manager waits caused by excessive partitioning.
- Initially, daily partitions were created for an orders table, resulting in many partitions and indexes that overwhelmed the lock manager.

**Problems Identified**

1. **Lock Contention:** As the number of partitions increased, so did the number of locks required per query, leading to significant contention.
2. **PostgreSQL 13 Limitation:** Even when querying a single partition, PostgreSQL 13 would acquire locks on all partitions, exacerbating lock contention.
3. **Lock Manager Waits:** These waits became a significant portion of total query time as partitions accumulated.

**Solutions Implemented**

- The system was restructured from daily to weekly partitions to reduce the number of partitions and associated locks.
- Indexes were temporarily dropped during data migration to reduce locking overhead.
- Consideration was given to upgrading to PostgreSQL 14, where these locking issues have been addressed.

**PostgreSQL 14 Improvements**

- PostgreSQL 14 optimizes locking by only acquiring necessary locks for the queried partition rather than all partitions.
- New features like `DETACH PARTITION CONCURRENTLY` allow for less disruptive maintenance operations.
