### 1. **Motivation and Common Issues**

- **Rapid Growth and Data Type Limitations**: Tables may outgrow their initial data type choices, such as `integer` reaching its maximum limit of 2.1 billion, necessitating a change to `bigint`[1].
- **Non-Optimal Data Types**: Using `TEXT` for an ID column instead of `INTEGER` or `BIGINT` can lead to inefficiencies in storage and performance[1].

### 2. **Binary Compatible Data Types**

- **Understanding Binary Coercibility**: Data types must be binary coercible to change types without rewriting the table. For example, `XML` can be converted to `TEXT` easily, but the reverse requires a conversion function[1].
- **Binary Compatible Columns**: Columns with the same internal representation, such as `TEXT` and `VARCHAR`, can be changed without rewriting the table[1].

### 3. **ALTER TABLE Challenges**

- **Access Exclusive Lock**: `ALTER TABLE` with `ALTER COLUMN TYPE` requires an access exclusive lock, blocking all reads and writes, which is problematic for production databases[1].
- **Table Rewrite**: Changing data types that are not binary coercible requires rewriting the entire table, which is slow and requires double the disk space[1].

### 4. **Concurrent Solution**

- **Adding a New Column**: Add a new column with the desired data type (e.g., `bigint`) and copy data in batches to avoid performance issues[1].
- **Trigger Function**: Create a trigger function to replicate changes from the old column to the new column in real-time[1].
- **Procedure for Data Copy**: Use a procedure to copy data in batches, committing every 100,000 rows to avoid long transactions[1].
- **Progress Indicator**: Add a progress indicator by raising notices every million rows processed[1].

### 5. **DDL Execution**

- **Creating Indexes**: Create indexes concurrently to avoid blocking the table[1].
- **Executing DDL in One Transaction**: Execute all DDL statements in one transaction to minimize locking and ensure consistency[1].

### 6. **Additional Considerations**

- **Sequence Creation**: Create a sequence for the new primary key, starting from the next number after the last ID in the old column[1].
- **Avoiding Race Conditions**: When creating the sequence, it's advisable to skip a few numbers ahead to avoid race conditions[1].
- **Table Size and Maintenance**: The table may grow during the conversion but not double in size. Running `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE` after the conversion is recommended for optimal performance[1].

### Comparative Examples

#### **Incorrect Approach**

```sql
-- This will block the table and may take a long time
ALTER TABLE large_table ALTER COLUMN id TYPE bigint;
```

#### **Correct Concurrent Approach**

1. **Add New Column**

```sql
ALTER TABLE large_table ADD COLUMN id_new bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0;
```

2. **Create Trigger Function**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION large_table_trigger_function()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
    NEW.id_new = NEW.id;
    RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE TRIGGER large_table_trigger
BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON large_table
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE PROCEDURE large_table_trigger_function();
```

3. **Procedure to Copy Data**

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE large_table_sync_procedure()
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    batch_size integer := 100000;
    counter integer := 0;
BEGIN
    FOR id_value IN SELECT id FROM large_table LOOP
        UPDATE large_table SET id_new = id WHERE id = id_value;
        counter := counter + 1;
        IF counter % batch_size = 0 THEN
            COMMIT;
        END IF;
        IF counter % (batch_size * 10) = 0 THEN
            RAISE NOTICE 'Rows done: %', counter;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
    COMMIT;
END;
$$;

CALL large_table_sync_procedure();
```

4. **Create Index and Execute DDL**

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY large_table_id_new_index ON large_table (id_new);

DO $$
DECLARE
    new_start bigint;
BEGIN
    SELECT MAX(id_new) + 1 INTO new_start FROM large_table;
    EXECUTE 'CREATE SEQUENCE large_table_id_seq START ' || new_start;
    ALTER TABLE large_table ALTER COLUMN id_new SET DEFAULT nextval('large_table_id_seq');
    ALTER TABLE large_table DROP COLUMN id;
    ALTER TABLE large_table RENAME COLUMN id_new TO id;
    ALTER TABLE large_table ADD CONSTRAINT large_table_pkey PRIMARY KEY USING INDEX large_table_id_new_index;
    DROP TRIGGER large_table_trigger ON large_table;
    COMMIT;
END;
$$;
```

This approach ensures minimal downtime and avoids blocking the table for an extended period, making it suitable for production environments.
