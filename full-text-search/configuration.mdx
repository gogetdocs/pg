## PostgreSQL Full-Text Search: A Comprehensive Guide

### Introduction

PostgreSQL offers powerful full-text search capabilities that enable efficient querying of textual data. This guide provides a detailed overview of PostgreSQL's full-text search features, including configuration, indexing, and querying techniques.

### Key Components

1. **Text Normalization**: PostgreSQL's full-text search functionality starts by reducing input text to a normalized form called a `tsvector`. This process involves tokenizing the text into separate words, converting them to lowercase, and removing inflections by stemming[3][4].

2. **Query Parsing and Normalization**: Search queries are also normalized into a `tsquery` format, which represents a logical combination of search terms. This process includes tokenization, stemming, and the addition of logical operators such as AND, OR, and NOT[3][4].

3. **Indexing**: To speed up full-text search operations, PostgreSQL allows you to create indexes on `tsvector` columns. These indexes, called `tsvector` indexes, store pre-processed text data, enabling fast and efficient searching[3][4].

### Configuration

A text search configuration specifies all options necessary to transform a document into a `tsvector`. This includes the parser to use to break text into tokens and the dictionaries to use to transform each token into a lexeme. Every call of `to_tsvector` or `to_tsquery` needs a text search configuration to perform its processing[2][4].

### Example Configuration

To create a custom text search configuration, you can duplicate an existing configuration and modify it as needed. Here is an example of creating a configuration named `pg`:

```sql
CREATE TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION public.pg ( COPY = pg_catalog.english );

CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY pg_dict (
    TEMPLATE = synonym,
    SYNONYMS = pg_dict
);

CREATE TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY english_ispell (
    TEMPLATE = ispell,
    DictFile = english,
    AffFile = english,
    StopWords = english
);

ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION pg
    ALTER MAPPING FOR asciiword, asciihword, hword_asciipart,
                      word, hword, hword_part
    WITH pg_dict, english_ispell, english_stem;

ALTER TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION pg
    DROP MAPPING FOR email, url, url_path, sfloat, float;

SET default_text_search_config = 'public.pg';
```

### Practical Usage

To implement full-text search in PostgreSQL, follow these steps:

1. **Create a `tsvector` column**: Add a new column of type `tsvector` to your table to store the normalized text data.

```sql
ALTER TABLE articles ADD COLUMN search_vector tsvector;
```

2. **Populate the `tsvector` column**: Update the `search_vector` column with normalized text data from the relevant columns.

```sql
UPDATE articles SET search_vector = to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || content);
```

3. **Create an index**: Create an index on the `search_vector` column to speed up search operations.

```sql
CREATE INDEX articles_search_vector_idx ON articles USING gin(search_vector);
```

4. **Search for articles**: Use the `@@` operator to search for articles that match a given search query.

```sql
SELECT id, title FROM articles WHERE search_vector @@ to_tsquery('english', 'search terms');
```

### Advanced Query Techniques

PostgreSQL offers several functions for more user-friendly and flexible searches:

- **`plainto_tsquery`**: Converts plain text to a `tsquery`, treating the input as a phrase.
- **`phraseto_tsquery`**: Similar to `plainto_tsquery`, but it also creates phrase searches.
- **`websearch_to_tsquery`**: Supports a syntax similar to what web search engines use.

Here are examples of using these functions:

```sql
SELECT id, title FROM articles WHERE search_vector @@ plainto_tsquery('search terms');

SELECT id, title FROM articles WHERE search_vector @@ phraseto_tsquery('search terms');

SELECT id, title FROM articles WHERE search_vector @@ websearch_to_tsquery('search terms');
```

### Ranking and Highlighting

PostgreSQL provides functions to rank and highlight search results:

- **`ts_rank`**: Assigns a relevance score to each result.
- **`ts_headline`**: Creates an excerpt of the content with the matching terms highlighted.

Here is an example of using these functions:

```sql
SELECT id, title, ts_rank(search_vector, query) as rank, ts_headline('english', content, query) as excerpt
FROM articles, to_tsquery('english', 'search terms') query
WHERE search_vector @@ query
ORDER BY rank DESC;
```

### Fuzzy Searching

While PostgreSQL's built-in full-text search does not support fuzzy searching, you can use an extension like `pg_trgm` to combine full-text search and fuzzy search in the same SQL query.

Here is an example of using `pg_trgm` for fuzzy searching:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pg_trgm;

SELECT id, title FROM articles WHERE similarity('search terms', content) > 0.5;
```
