## PostgreSQL Full Text Search Limitations

### Overview

PostgreSQL's full text search feature has several limitations that developers should be aware of when designing and implementing text search functionality in their applications.

### Limitations

The following are the current limitations of PostgreSQL's text search features:

- **Lexeme length**: The length of each lexeme must be less than 2 kilobytes.
- **TSVector length**: The length of a tsvector (lexemes + positions) must be less than 1 megabyte.
- **Number of lexemes**: The number of lexemes must be less than 2^64.
- **Position values**: Position values in tsvector must be greater than 0 and no more than 16,383.
- **Match distance**: The match distance in a `<N>` (FOLLOWED BY) tsquery operator cannot be more than 16,384.
- **Positions per lexeme**: No more than 256 positions per lexeme.
- **Number of nodes**: The number of nodes (lexemes + operators) in a tsquery must be less than 32,768.

### Examples

To illustrate these limitations, let's consider two examples:

- The PostgreSQL 8.1 documentation contains 10,441 unique words, a total of 335,420 words, and the most frequent word "postgresql" is mentioned 6,127 times in 655 documents.
- The PostgreSQL mailing list archives contain 910,989 unique words with 57,491,343 lexemes in 461,020 messages.

### PostgreSQL SQL Examples

Here are some examples of how these limitations might be encountered in PostgreSQL SQL code:

```sql
-- Create a table with a tsvector column
CREATE TABLE documents (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    content tsvector
);

-- Insert a document with a long lexeme
INSERT INTO documents (content)
VALUES (to_tsvector('This is a very long lexeme that exceeds the 2 kilobyte limit'));

-- Error: lexeme too long

-- Insert a document with a large tsvector
INSERT INTO documents (content)
VALUES (to_tsvector('This is a very large tsvector that exceeds the 1 megabyte limit'));

-- Error: tsvector too long

-- Create a tsquery with a large number of nodes
SELECT * FROM documents
WHERE content @@ to_tsquery('This is a very complex tsquery with many nodes');

-- Error: too many nodes in tsquery
```

Note that these examples are contrived and intended to illustrate the limitations of PostgreSQL's full text search features. In practice, developers should design their applications to avoid encountering these limitations.
